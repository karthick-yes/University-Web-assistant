 The Department of History
 
 
The
History
Major
at
Ashoka
University
seeks
both
to
equip
students
with
the
historian’s
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
toolbox
and
trains
them
on
how
to
use
it.
A
historian
combines
the
skills
of
a
detective,
a
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
scavenger,
a
judge
and
a
ventriloquist.
S/he
is
an
artist
and
a
skilled
craftsperson
who
spins
and
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
weaves
narratives
of
the
past.
Historical
creativity
lies
in
gathering,
wrestling
with,
and
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
connecting
the
traces
of
the
past
to
construct
a
rich
tapestry
of
human
lives,
emotions,
and
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
ideas.
These
traces
come
in
various
garbs
–
gravestones,
burial
sites,
forgotten
cities,
mud
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
pots,
musical
notes,
folklores,
war
songs,
memoirs,
archival
records,
speeches,
letters,
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
newspapers,
cartoons,
cave
art,
paintings,
architecture,
clothes,
food,
chronicles,
cinema,
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
advertisements – all and any remnant of human existence.
 
A
historian’s
ability
to
make
effective
use
of
these
materials
requires
inculcation
of
two
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
core
ideas:
empathy
and
imagination.
Empathy
fuels
and
glues
our
connection
with
other
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
humans.
It
helps
us
recognize
others’
perceptions,
feelings
and
ways
of
being.
Empathy
is
a
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
vital
tool
of
a
historian
because
it
obligates
a
historian
to
question
and
challenge
a
single
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
conception
of
the
world
in
order
to
access
other
worlds
and
other
lives.
Thus
the
spirit
of
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
questioning
and
the
consciousness
of
one’s
own
frames
of
reference
is
the
starting
point
of
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
historical
inquiry.
The
second
feature
of
imagination
is
the
creative
faculty
which
enables
us
to
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
form
images
and
feelings
that
ordinary
senses
cannot
perceive.
It
is
a
critical
instrument
for
a
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
historian
who
studies
worlds
that
are
removed
both
in
time
and
space
from
his
or
her
own.
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
Conjuring
up
those
historical
worlds
requires
a
leap
of
imagination,
a
willing
suspension
of
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
disbelief and a readiness to encounter the unknown.
 
 
 
HISTORY MAJOR, MINOR, & CONCENTRATION
 
 
The
Department
of
History
requires
students
to
take
a
total
of
​
12
courses
in
three
years
in
order
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
to
receive
the
History
Major
degree
and
​
10
to
receive
the
History-IR
Major
degree,
according
to
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
UGC
guidelines.
However,
the
course
should
be
considered
as
a
four
year
programme,
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
including
the
‘Advanced
Major’,
which
brings
the
total
courses
to
16
in
four
years
for
History
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
Majors and 14 for History-IR Majors.
 
 
History
students
have
to
do
a
mix
of
compulsory
and
elective
courses.
Compulsory
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
courses
provide
students
with
a
basic
grounding
in
the
discipline.
Elective
courses
seek
to
stir,
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
whet,
and
capture
a
student’s
historical
imagination
through
a
conceptual,
historiographical
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
and
methodological
study
of
different
historical
themes
and
subjects.
In
addition,
the
UG
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
Research
Thesis/Project
(for
third-year
students)
and
the
Capstone
Thesis
(for
ASP
students)
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
offer
History
students
opportunities
to
put
into
practice
their
understanding
of
the
discipline
of
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
history by undertaking independent inquiry on their chosen historical themes.

History Major Requirements
 
 
 
A
Major
is
the
field
of
a
student’s
primary
academic
focus
in
the
course
of
their
undergraduate
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
degree.
For
a
Major
in
History,
students
must
take
a
total
of
​
12
​
courses
in
History.
History
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
majors
must
take
​
all
5
gateway
courses
(HIS
1001,
HIS
2001,
HIS
2002,
HIS
2003,
and
HIS
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
2004).
These
five
gateway
courses
give
students
a
solid
foundation
in
the
history
of
the
general
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
patterns
and
processes
of
Indian
and
modern
European
history
within
a
global
comparative
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
framework.
These
courses
provide
students
with
chronological
anchors
for
more
advanced
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
thematic courses.
 
Along
with
the
gateways,
​
2
reading
courses,
(HIS-3001
&
HIS-3002)
equip
students
with
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
the
basic
apparatus
of
the
historical
craft.
Reading
History
introduces
students
to
different
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
theories
that
have
influenced
historical
imagination,
the
various
schools
of
thought
and
modes
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
of
writing
history
such
as
positivism,
Marxism,
annals,
structuralism,
post-structuralism,
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
postmodernism
and
postcolonialism.
Reading
Archaeology
introduces
students
to
the
methods
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
and
theories
of
archaeology
globally,
and
engages
students
with
the
history
of
archaeological
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
thought.

participates
in
the
lesson

process,
ideally
meeting
the
faculty

learn
how
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
grading
is
done.
The
Teaching
Practicum
is
considered
as
an
apprenticeship,
in

for
the
rest
of
the
course.
The

Language Courses
 
 
The
Department
of
History
currently
offers
two
languages
-
Sanskrit
and
Persian.
The
objective
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
for
this
is
to
equip
History
students
for
historical
research
in
the
future.
The
department
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
strongly
encourages
its
students
to
learn
at
least
one
of
these
languages
while
they
are
at
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
Ashoka.
Currently,
​
any
​
one
language
course
(Persian/
Sanskrit)
can
count
in
lieu
of
​
one
History
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
elective
in
the
total
course
tally
of
History
students.
Beyond
this,
students
can
take
as
many
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
language
courses
as
they
want.
In
future,
the
department
will
explore
options
for
making
more
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
language courses available for its students.
 
 
Language Courses currently on offer:
 
 
Monsoon Semester:

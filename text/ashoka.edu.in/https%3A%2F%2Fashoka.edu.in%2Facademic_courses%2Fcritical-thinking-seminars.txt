Writing, communication and critical thinking are the cornerstones of Ashoka’s academic culture.  All students who graduate from Ashoka are expected to acquire superior skills in organizing their thoughts both orally and in writing; indeed, Ashoka students are discouraged from rote learning and, instead, critically engage and reshape concepts through questioning and writing. The platform for these skills begins in Introduction to Critical Thinking (ICT), a required first-year course, and continues in elective Critical Thinking Seminars offered by various departments. All CT seminars are distinguished by small class size, close faculty attention to students’ writing, communication and thinking processes, and individualized tutoring at Ashoka’s  (CWC).

This course will explore concepts in environmental economics which integrates theory, policy and empirical topics. Focus will be on issues related to externalities and limitations in effective regulation due to poor monitoring, legislation and execution. The course will focus on questions like - what are the environmental problems faced around the world, what are the policy instruments which have been chosen to counter environmental degradation, how do regulations (related to air and water pollution) take different forms in different countries etc. Empirical papers linking environmental degradation with health and economic development will also be covered in this course.

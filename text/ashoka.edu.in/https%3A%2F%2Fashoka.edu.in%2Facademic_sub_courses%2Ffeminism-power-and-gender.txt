The course will explore questions of power and its engagement with ideas of sex and gender. The course asks questions like: How do feminists talk about ‘women’? What is the relevance of feminist theory to policy issues? What have been some of the most relevant theoretical interventions in the subject? Within these larger issues, the course will examine the interrelations of caste, gender, sexuality and class and also specific questions pertaining to power like pornography, environment, religion, and violence among others.

Ashoka University’s list of graduate academic programmes provides students with exhaustive knowledge of their subject areas and prepares them to tackle future real-world problems and challenges.









Ashoka University offers three types of postgraduate programmes at present. The first is the Young India Fellowship (YIF), a one-year multidisciplinary diploma programme in Liberal Studies. Fellows then, have the option to pursue their Masters in Liberal Studies (MLS) after graduating from the YIF. Fellows who have been accepted by an Ashoka University faculty mentor to work on a specific research project as a graduate assistant, stay back for an additional year to pursue their MA liberal arts. The programme is highly interdisciplinary and entails coursework from a variety of disciplines.

Apart from this, Ashoka University’s Masters programme in Economics has been developed to provide students with the opportunity to be trained in modern Economics by highly qualified economists and the MA programme in English will provide a unique intellectual experience for these students while carving out a much-needed path to higher studies abroad and in India.













Ashoka University’s MA programme in Economics mentors students to think across boundaries of genre, culture & time. The programme’s curriculum introduces students to a wide array of texts, theories & disciplinary formations from around the world. The programme lets students pursue courses in other departments at the University for integrated education. 

















Ashoka University’s MA programme in Liberal Studies is a 32-credit, a one-year programme offered to students who have graduated with a diploma in Liberal Studies from the Young India Fellowship, and have been accepted by an Ashoka University faculty mentor to work on a specific research project as a graduate assistant. This programme’s interdisciplinary module contains coursework from a variety of disciplines, including Humanities, Social Sciences, Behavioural Sciences, and Natural Sciences. The University aims to train students to think critically about their disciplines of interest while deriving insights from other disciplines. The MA programme in Liberal Studies also helps students to prepare their graduate applications.

The Masters in Biology programme at Ashoka University is designed to impart holistic training in the fundamentals of physical and chemical principles of biology, in the diverse yet connected areas ranging from evolution and organismal biology to cell-molecular and computational biology. This unique program will allow a small cohort of motivated students (20 or less) to customize their specialized learning based on individual interests. Students will learn through hands-on training aided by contemporary and innovative pedagogical methods as well as through extensive independent research.

















Ashoka University, in compliance with UGC guidelines, offers a 3-year Bachelor’s Degree programme.  It also offers a year-long Postgraduate Diploma in Advanced Studies and Research (DipASR). All undergraduates graduating with Bachelor’s Degrees at the end of their third year, or who have completed by that time at least academic 92 credits of their degree programme, are eligible for admission into the Postgraduate Diploma in Advanced Studies and Research programme, also known as the Ashoka Scholars Programme (ASP). Students who need to complete up to 8 credits of their undergraduate degree must do so within the first semester of the ASP. All students who fall into either of these categories must formally apply for admission to the ASP towards the end of the Spring semester of their third year. The exact date will be circulated by the OAA.

Since 2011, over 1700 individuals from India and abroad have commenced their lifelong journeys as Young India Fellows.
Fellows are equipped with perspectives, knowledge and capabilities that help them understand the world better and engage with their field of study or practice through a multidisciplinary approach. This becomes critical for effective leadership, especially in the post-pandemic era.
Fellows keep coming back to the Fellowship, and contribute to shaping and nurturing it further. They continue to support and collaborate with each other and with members of the larger Ashoka ecosystem in their professional and personal pursuits, regardless of what they do.

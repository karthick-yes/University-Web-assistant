Designed to accompany the two theory courses Quantum Mechanics and Statistical Mechanics, this laboratory course explores their experimental foundations.


Students will be introduced to some of the experiments which required Quantum Mechanics in order to be explained, notably discrete atomic spectra and the Zeeman Effect. The lab will also contain experiments on Brownian Motion and the determination of other properties of matter like magnetic susceptibility.


Pre-requisites: Physics Lab I.

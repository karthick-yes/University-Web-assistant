This course focuses on developing an algorithmic approach to problem solving, and on the translation of algorithms to working computer codes. The course starts from  the basics of computations and  errors, and then discusses both deterministic problems and those involving random numbers, like Monte Carlo.


Prerequisites: None.


Taught at the level of: Computational Physics: Problem Solving with Computers (R H Landau, M J Paez, and C C Bordeianu), Numerical Recipes: The Art of Scientific Computing (W H Press, S A Teukolsky, W T Vetterling, B P Flannery).

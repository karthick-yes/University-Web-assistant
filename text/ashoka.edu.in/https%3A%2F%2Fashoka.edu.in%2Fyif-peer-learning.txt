The YIF cohort is rich in demographic diversity. Fellows come from different geographies, varied education disciplines and socio-economic backgrounds. Many of them excel in extracurricular activities and avocations, and have won accolades in their areas of expertise. A substantial percentage of the cohort also has work experience. With excellent academic support, infrastructure and resources, the Fellowship becomes a platform for the Fellows to share knowledge. 
At the YIF, an engineer, a filmmaker, a history major, a Kathak dancer, a banker, a social entrepreneur, a pharmacist and a journalist, all attend lectures together. This creates an unparalleled peer learning environment rich with multiple perspectives.
Every aspect of the YIF, whether academic, experiential, cultural or informal, allows you to engage with your diverse set of peers in multiple ways and build a close-knit community. Every year, fellows come together to organise the Friends of YIF Day – an opportunity for you and your peers to showcase your talent to members of the Ashoka community. Fellows also self-organize to learn from each other – from Brazilian Jiu Jitsu and becoming a pro at Excel, to learning arts like sculpting and body flow movement.

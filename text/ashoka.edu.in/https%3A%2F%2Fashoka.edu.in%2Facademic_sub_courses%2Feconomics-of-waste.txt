Waste generation and disposal is an important, yet a neglected part of our daily lives. This course delves on different aspects of waste management. The course is divided into four parts. The first situates the course in the broad realm of Environmental Economics. It introduces the concepts of property rights and public goods. The second part looks at solid waste creation, collection and disposal. Third part talks about recycling, and design for the environment. The final part introduces the concept of Circular Economy.


Since the course derives its relevance from current waste management practices, class participation, presentations and discussions are of utmost importance.

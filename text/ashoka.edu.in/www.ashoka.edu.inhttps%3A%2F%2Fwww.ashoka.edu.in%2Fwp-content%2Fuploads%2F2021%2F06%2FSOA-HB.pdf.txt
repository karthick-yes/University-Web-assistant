Monsoon 2020
 
 
  
Department of Sociology & Anthropology
 
Sociology & Anthropology at Ashoka
 
The
undergraduate
programme
in
Sociology
and
Anthropology
(SOA)
at
Ashoka
University
is
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
designed
for
students
interested
in
cultivating
an
intellectually
rigorous
understanding
of
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
diverse
social
worlds
and
processes
as
they
emerge,
stabilise,
transform
and
dissolve
all
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
around us.
 
 
The
Department
acknowledges
the
unique
relationship
between
sociology
and
social
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
anthropology
as
it
has
developed
and
flourished
in
India.
While
our
faculty
is
actively
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
engaged
in
long-term
fieldwork
and
ethnographic
research
across
a
range
of
subjects
and
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
sites,
as
a
collective,
we
emphasise
the
critical
empiricism,
theoretical
engagement
and
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
comparative
approach
central
to
our
best
disciplinary
traditions.
In
doing
so,
we
constantly
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
work
at
and
move
between
multiple
scales
and
modes
of
analysis:
across
the
‘micro’
and
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
the
‘macro’,
the
‘general’
and
the
‘particular’,
the
‘local’
and
the
‘global’,
the
‘social’
and
the
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
‘technical’, the ‘material’ and ‘abstract’, and the ‘qualitative’ and ‘quantitative’.
 
 
Our
research
and
pedagogical
practices
also
open
up
numerous
possibilities
for
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
interdisciplinary
explorations
with
students
and
scholars
in
allied
fields
of
social
thought
and
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
inquiry,
including,
history,
economics,
political
science,
psychology,
philosophy,
linguistics,
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
environmental
studies,
computer
science,
planning
and
design,
natural
sciences,
arts
and
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
aesthetics,
law
and
media.
This
makes
Sociology
and
Anthropology
at
once
among
the
most
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
grounded and fluid disciplines in the contemporary university.
 
 
The Undergraduate Major in Sociology and Anthropology
 
The
Sociology
and
Anthropology
Major
at
Ashoka
will
train
future
scholars
and
professionals
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
to
be
engaged
observers,
attentive
readers,
clear
writers,
and
rigorous
social
analysts.
Over
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
the
course
of
their
study,
our
students
will
develop
a
critical
awareness
of
changing
social
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
values
and
practices,
the
capacity
to
think
relationally,
and
the
skills
to
draw
out
vital
but
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
often
invisible
connections.
In
this
way,
they
will
learn
how
to
describe
and
explain
complex
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
social
processes.
Above
all,
we
are
convinced
that
our
students
will
engage
with
the
world
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
and
come
to
inhabit
it
in
ways
that
open
up
new
possibilities
for
shaping
shared
futures.
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
These
possibilities
are
at
the
heart
of
what
we
think
it
means
to
nurture
an
anthropological
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
imagination.
 
SOA
Majors
must
complete
12
courses
in
the
discipline
to
graduate
with
a
B.A.
in
Sociology
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
and
Anthropology.
All
students
will
take
6
(out
of
a
set
of
8)
compulsory
courses
specially
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
designed
to
introduce
them
to
the
“core”
fields
of
the
discipline:
key
concepts
and
themes
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
that
are
at
the
centre
of
both
classical
and
contemporary
work
in
Sociology
and
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
Anthropology.
Building
on
and
out
from
these
courses,
Majors
will
then
select
a
series
of
6
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 electives
from
a
wide
range
of
course
offerings.
All
SOA
courses,
both
cores
and
electives,
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
will
create
space
for
students
to
explore
their
own,
individual
interests
and
questions,
but
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
the
electives
are
especially
intended
to
give
advanced
undergraduates
a
sense
of
the
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
breadth
of
the
discipline
and
the
frontiers
of
anthropological
research.
The
set
of
core
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
courses
also
includes
a
hands-on
Research
Methods
course
that
all
Majors
will
take
in
their
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
third
year.
Instead
of
confining
the
Sociology
and
Anthropology
of
India
to
a
single
course,
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
the
study
of
India
and
South
Asia
will
be
woven
in
throughout
the
curriculum
and
critical
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
themes
(such
as
caste,
hierarchy
and
stratification)
will
be
explored
in
multiple
and
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
interrelated courses.
 
The Eight Core Courses:
 
 
SOA
1101:
​
Sociology
and
the
Making
of
Concepts
is
our
‘Gateway
Course’
and
may
be
taken
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
in
the
first
or
second
year
at
Ashoka.
It
is
compulsory
for
all
SOA
Majors,
who
must
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
complete this course by the end of the second year.
 
 
In
addition,
Majors
are
required
to
take
at
least
4
of
the
following
6
courses.
Most
Majors
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
will
complete
this
set
of
courses
in
their
second
year,
but
they
can
be
taken
in
any
order
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
depending
on
student
interest
and
course
sequencing
in
a
given
year.
Students
have
the
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
option and are encouraged to take all 6 courses in this set should they wish to do so.

The Ashoka Scholars Program (4
​
th
​
 year) in Sociology and Anthropology
 
 
The
fourth
year
will
give
Majors
an
opportunity
to
pursue
an
independent,
original
and
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
closely
supervised
research
project,
which
will
culminate
in
an
undergraduate
thesis.
For
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
obtaining
an
Advanced
Diploma
in
Sociology
and
Anthropology,
students
need
to
submit
a
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
proposal
in
March.
Detailed
guidelines
for
the
proposal
will
be
shared
with
third
years
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
during
the
Monsoon
semester.
The
following
are
the
guidelines
for
those
considering
the
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
Advanced Major in Sociology and Anthropology:
 
 
 
●
The
course,
​
Anthropology’s
Methods
will
help
prospective
Advanced
Majors
to
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
develop
research
proposals
and
plans.
Fieldwork
can
be
conducted
over
the
summer
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
between semesters 6 & 7 continuing into semester 7.
 
 
●
In
addition
to
working
under
the
guidance
of
a
faculty
advisor,
Advanced
Majors
will
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
participate
in
a
​
Monsoon
and
Spring
Thesis
Workshop
​
,
each
for
4
credits.
These
will
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
be
intensive
weekly
sessions
facilitated
by
different
members
of
the
faculty
and
will
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
focus
on
critical
aspects
of
the
research
process:
framing
questions,
fieldwork
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
methods,
data
analysis,
working
on
annotated
bibliographies,
developing
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 anthropological
arguments,
and
ethnographic
writing.
Students
will
make
regular
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
presentations and share their writing with each other.
 
 
●
The
final
thesis
should
be
between
10,000-15,000
words
and
cover
8
credits
(4
each
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
semester). The thesis will be evaluated by the faculty advisor.
 
 
●
Fourth-years
will
also
have
the
opportunity
to
gain
experience
as
​
Teaching
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
Assistants
​
 (with a minimum of 2 credits of Teaching Practicum).
 
 
●
The
ASP
cohort
will
also
organise
(for
2
credits
per
student)
an
​
annual
Symposium
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
hosted
by
the
department
and
conceptualised,
curated
and
organised
by
the
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
fourth-year students.
 
 
●
To
complete
the
required
24
credits,
fourth-years
will
be
able
to
take
an
​
additional
1
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
departmental elective
​
 to broaden and deepen their engagement with the discipline.
 
 
Please
note
that
ASP
students
can
take
more
than
one
course
either
in
Sociology
or
other
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
subjects during their ASP programme, but that would not count towards 24 credits.
 
 
 
The
Department
also

Frequently Asked Questions
 
 
Q: Is the 1000/2000/3000 level system an equivalent to the 100/200/300 level system?
 
A:
​
 Yes.
 
 
Q: Is it mandatory for majors to finish 1101 by the end of second year?
 
A
​
: Yes. Majors must complete this course by the end of their second year.
 
 Q: Is it mandatory to complete the 2000 level core course requirement by the end of the
 
second year?
 
A
​
: It is not mandatory, but we strongly recommend that you do so since 3000 level electives
 
require at least two of the 2000 level core courses as prerequisites and you will get much
 
more from these courses if you have taken the set of 2000-level cores.
 
 
Q: What is the policy on cross-listed courses?
 
A
​
: Cross-listed courses are those courses which arise out of a discipline different from SOA
 
but are cross-listed with SOA. The students can only count two cross listed courses towards
 
their Major and Minor.
 
 
Q: Do the prerequisites also apply to the 3000 level cross-listed courses or summer
 
courses?
 
A
​
: Yes.
 
 
Q: I took a course in Monsoon 2019 which was cross-listed with SOA. It is being offered
 
again in 2020 but is not showing as cross-listed. Is this a problem?
 
A
​
: No. It is normal for courses to not be cross-listed with other departments in every
 
semester that they’re offered. If you took a course, which was cross-listed in the semester
 
that you took it, it will count towards your degree. Please cross-check the course code of
 
such courses in your LMS.
 
 
Q: Can I write a thesis in the third year?
 
A
​
: No. Only ASPs can write a thesis with the department.
 
 
 
Q: I’m going on a semester abroad. Can I substitute the required courses with a summer
 
abroad course?
 
A
​
: The specific course along with its detailed syllabus will need to be shared with the
 
Department’s HOD and a decision will be taken on a case-by-case basis.
 
 
Q: I’m interested in TAing for the Monsoon semester. How should I proceed?
 
A
​
: Only ASP students are eligible to TA for courses. The Department notifies all ASPs of TA
 
requirements in the beginning of the semester and calls for applications.
 
 
Q: Whom should I contact for further queries?
 
A
​
: You can email the Student Representative 
​
Reeva Dani
​
 (reeva.dani_ug20@ashoka.edu.in)
 
and cc the Department Manager 
​
Anjali Panwar
​
 (anjali.panwar@ashoka.edu.in) for any
 
queries.
 
 
Q: I am confused about which 2000 level (or 3000 level) courses to opt for. Is there
 
someone I can talk to?
 A
​
: You may consult the course descriptions provided on the LMS or may reach out to your
 
peers or seniors who have already taken courses you may be interested in. You can also
 
consult your year advisor for seeking guidance.
 
 
Q: I’m unsure whether I want to major in Sociology or in Politics and Society. Is there
 
someone I can talk to?
 
A
​
:  You can consult your year advisor for seeking guidance related to the discipline and the
 
department.
 
 
Q: Is there a definitive order that courses have to be taken in?
 
A
​
: We recommend that you take the 1000 level course first. Then take the core 2000 level
 
core courses. This will not only ensure that you have fulfilled the prerequisites for the
 
3000-level electives, but you will get much more from the advanced elective courses when
 
you take them.
 
 
 
Q: Can I take 2000 level courses before the 1000 level introductory requirement?
 
A
​
: Yes, you can take the 2000 level core courses before the 1000 level courses, but we
 
recommend that you take 1101 as your first course in SOA and then opt for 2000 level core
 
courses.
 
 
Q: Can I opt for 3000 level courses while taking 2000 level courses at the same time?
 
A
​
: Yes, you can, provided you fulfill the prerequisite for 3000 level electives, which is 1101
 
and any two 2000 level courses.
 
 
 
Q: Can the elective requirements be fulfilled by any 2000 or 3000 level courses?
 
A
​
: After fulfilling the required number of level-based requirements, you are free to take
 
2000 or 3000 level courses to fulfill your remaining requirements

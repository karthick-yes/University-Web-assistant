This course aims at undertaking an economic analysis of the issues affecting women in the economy while also drawing inspiration from the fields of evolutionary biology, feminism and psychology. The discrimination faced by women in market scenarios, such as those of labour and credit, as well as the impact of globalization on women will be studied. Further, the course explores issues that women face in non-market situations such as bargaining within the household, marriage and fertility, discriminatory cultural norms and how market and non-market scenarios interact to influence women’s well-being. Lastly, the role of education, healthcare, property rights, birth control, political franchise and representation in mitigating gender-based inequalities will be studied. Microeconomics and Econometrics are the prerequisites for this course.

This course will be an introduction to experimental economics, its methods, and some of the major subject areas that have been addressed by laboratory experiments. Substantive areas of application in the course will include market equilibrium, individual decision-making, risk and uncertainty, strategic interactions, learning in games, public good provision, and labor market relationships. Additional topics may include field experiments in development economics. The students will also learn the software zTree, which is typically used to design the computer interface of laboratory experiments. The course will be conducted in a seminar fashion with discussions based on the day's readings. The final project for this class will be an experimental design based on an original idea.

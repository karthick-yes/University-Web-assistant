Undergraduate Writing Programme (UWP)











The Undergraduate Writing Programme at Ashoka University is one of the first writing and critical thinking programmes of its kind in the country. Our programme, developed bottom-up for the Indian context, is designed to cultivate rigorous writing practices in first-year students. It is our understanding that an education in the liberal arts is built upon the foundation of analytical thinking communicated through clear and persuasive writing across disciplines.
 
To foster these critical competencies, our instructors give individual attention to each student’s communication skills, both written and oral, at the level of structure, sentence, and vocabulary. Our flagship course, Introduction to Critical Thinking, is taught through small, seminar-style classes, which employ the best writing pedagogy practices from across the world to nurture writing and critical thinking in the first year of undergraduate training.

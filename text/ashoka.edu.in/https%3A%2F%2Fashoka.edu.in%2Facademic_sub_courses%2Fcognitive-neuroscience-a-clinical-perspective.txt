This course will approach cognitive neuroscience from a clinical, neurological perspective. We willexamine how different disorders of the brain can affect a wide range of cognitive functions and whatthe study of cognitive disorders can contribute to our understanding of normal cognitive processes.In order to understand better the world of cognitive disorders, we will start with a general overviewof brain diseases, with a particular emphasis on stroke and neurodegeneration, the two most commonpathological processes affecting human cognition. We will then discuss in more detail aphasias anddementias, as disorders affecting predominantly language and memory respectively. We will alsolook at disorders of visuo-spatial functions, executive functions and social cognition.

The course is intended to introduce you to the way economists think, and provide you with some of the tools, language, and rigour to assess and understand the world around us. You will be introduced to certain aspects of economic history, principles of decision making in a world marked by scarcity, strategic interaction, the behaviour of firms and consumers, and the concept of a market. We will also go on to cover other topics, including economic fluctuations and their impact on unemployment, globalisation and trade, inequality and poverty. By the end of the course, you should be able to critically think from an economist’s point of view about a number of topics and policy questions facing economies around the world.

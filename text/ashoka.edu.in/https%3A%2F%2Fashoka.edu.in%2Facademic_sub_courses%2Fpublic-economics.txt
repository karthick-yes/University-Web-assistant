This course will cover the role of government in modern economies. We will dig deep into the study of various instruments used to generate government revenue and analyze efficient ways to spend government monies. You will also be exposed to microeconomic models that are used to study the reaction of agents to government policies. This course will serve as an introduction to various empirical tools used in modern public economics. Government expenditure, externalities, public goods, taxation, social security programs, are some of the topics that will be covered in this course. Abstract concepts will be mapped to real-world examples to develop your public economics intuition.

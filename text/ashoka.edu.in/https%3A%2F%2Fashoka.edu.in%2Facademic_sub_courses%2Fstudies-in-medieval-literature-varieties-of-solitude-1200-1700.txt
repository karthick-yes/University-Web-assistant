This course investigates the premodern history of solitariness, as a condition and experience, and its intellectual and emotional ramifications, among them self-discovery, contemplation of God, creative inspiration, and loneliness. Primary readings will include monastic texts, Arthurian romances, Chaucer, Milton, and the metaphysical poets, while secondary readings will focus on recent work in the history of emotions and affect studies.

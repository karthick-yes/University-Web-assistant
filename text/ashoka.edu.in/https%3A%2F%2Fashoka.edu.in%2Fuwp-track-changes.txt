Track Changes is a bi-monthly webinar series organized by the Undergraduate Writing Programme. Through these conversations, instructors from the UWP explore areas at the intersection of Art, Theory, Praxis, Culture, Science and Technology, with experts in various fields. Each month, one of the webinar sessions is dedicated to issues surrounding the craft and process of writing, while the other session engages with issues related to critical thinking more broadly. Conceiving of writing as an inherently dialogic process, Track Changes seeks to offer a regular avenue for dialogue and thought, through stimulating conversations with diverse interlocutors including writers, artists, journalists, academics, activists, and researchers in various fields. The conversations at Track Changes are variegated.











Here are some of the webinars we have organized: The Future of Publishing in India with Ananth Padmanabhan, CEO of HarperCollins India and Udayan Mitra, their Literary Division publisher. Writing Public Health: A Journalist’s Perspective with Anoo Bhuyan, the healthcare reporter at IndiaSpend.  Writing the Past: Narratives of Feminist Resistance with poet and writer Sharanya Manivannan, the award-winning author of five books, including the short story collection The High Priestess Never Marries and the novel The Queen of Jasmine Country.

On 24th November, the Undergraduate Writing Programme hosted a session with Ikroop Sandhu, an author and artist from Dharamshala, who was in conversation with Arpita Das. 
About the author: After a BA in Philosophy from Lady Shri Ram College she studied animation from Vancouver Film School. As an artist, her interest lies in an individual’s capacity for knowledge gathering, storytelling and reflecting. She is currently teaching storytelling and animation at the Indian Institute of Art and Design, New Delhi. Her work has been published in three graphic narrative anthologies and her first graphic novel—a biography of Bhagat Singh titled ‘Inquilab Zindabad’, was published earlier this year.
About the book: Far from the gun-toting, swaggering young man represented in pop culture, Bhagat Singh was a fearless student leader who spent his time reading, writing, debating, strategising and executing plans while working alongside his comrades. Detailing the life of a national icon, Inquilab Zindabad maps Bhagat Singh’s journey toward revolutionising the Indian freedom struggle and the people and events that influenced this quest. While Inquilab Zindabad sheds light on his family members, friends, comrades and secret benefactors, excerpts from Bhagat Singh’s revolutionary writings on religion, caste and freedom are also present throughout the book. Informing the reader of his astute observations on politics and revolutionary life, the lessons from his life and writings are more relevant today than ever before.

On 14th April, the Undergraduate Writing Programme (in a special partnership with the Ashoka PPE Society) organised the first offline instalment of Track Changes. This event featured author and World Bank economist  in conversation with the students of Ashoka University about her widely acclaimed book .
: “How many books do you know that effortlessly navigate Shah Rukh Khan’s movies, recent economic theories, data on jobs, juicy gossip about the peculiarities of Delhi playboys, sociological narratives and a deep dive into the love-lives of young Indian women? This intelligent, charming and quirky book, an illuminating portrait of the dire state of gender relations in contemporary India, does all that and more. Read it.” – Prof Abhijit Banerjee, Nobel Laureate for Economics, Author of Poor Economics, FT Business Book of the Year.
In this pathbreaking work, Shrayana Bhattacharya maps the economic and personal trajectories–the jobs, desires, prayers, love affairs and rivalries–of a diverse group of women. Divided by class but united in fandom, they remain steadfast in their search for intimacy, independence and fun. Embracing Hindi film idol Shah Rukh Khan allows them a small respite from an oppressive culture, a fillip to their fantasies of a friendlier masculinity in Indian men. Most struggle to find the freedom-or income-to follow their favourite actor. A most unusual and compelling book on the female gaze, this is the story of how women have experienced post-liberalization India.
: Shrayana Bhattacharya trained in development economics at Delhi University and Harvard University. Since 2014, in her role as an economist at the World Bank, she has focused on issues related to social policy and jobs. Prior to this, she worked on research projects with the Centre for Policy Research, SEWA Union and Institute of Social Studies Trust. Her writing has appeared in the Indian Express, EPW, Indian Quarterly and The Caravan.

The PPE major combines three of the most prominent approaches to understanding the social and political world, the way it shapes individuals, and the way individuals shape it. The knowledge and skills it inculcates in students are relevant for a whole range of careers, including but not restricted to politics, journalism, the media, social activism, the NGO sector, business, law, and academia. Students will emerge with honed discussion skills and with a level of sophistication to their thinking about society’s workings and the best way to address its ills. The Political Science and Economics components enable students to develop an understanding of the many social forces at work around them, and the Philosophy component enables them to reason about these forces with rigour.











The department recommends that students complete mathematics in Classes 11 and 12 to be eligible for any economics-related major or minor.
For students who have not studied mathematics in Classes 11 and 12, they must complete MAT 1000: Calculus and earn at least an A- in order to enroll in any Economics courses.
Students must complete 16 major courses from the three disciplines of Political Science, Philosophy and Economics (PPE) to complete this interdisciplinary major. From each of the three subject areas in PPE, students will choose a minimum of 4 courses (16 credits) and a maximum of 8 courses (32 credits), with a combined total of 16 courses (64 credits). Those who complete 8 courses (32 credits) in one subject (X) will graduate in ‘PPE, with specialization in X’.  This will be stated on their transcripts.
Political Science
A PPE major must complete at least 4 Political Science courses (16 credits).
Those taking only 4 courses must complete:

Introduction to Indian Politics
Western Political Thought (I) or Introduction to Political Theory

One additional Political Science course

For students completing only 4 Political Science courses, at most 1 cross-listed Political Science course can count towards the major.
For the specialization in political science, PPE majors must additionally complete 4 Political Science courses beyond the 4 required courses. At most 2 cross-listed Political Science courses can count towards a PPE major with specialization in political science.
Philosophy
A PPE major must complete at least 4 Philosophy courses (16 credits):

Introduction to Philosophy (PHI 1000)
Symbolic Logic (PHI 1060) (only required for UG23 and earlier; UG24 and later can complete any Philosophy elective)
Two Philosophy courses in two different categories from these three categories: Indian & Non-Western Philosophy, History of Western Philosophy, Contemporary Core

All 4 Philosophy courses must be taught by Philosophy faculty (that is, they cannot be cross-listed courses taught by faculty in other departments like Political Science). For more information on Philosophy course categories, see .
For a specialization in Philosophy, students must complete the following courses:

Introduction to Philosophy (PHI 1000)
Symbolic Logic (PHI 1060) (Only required for UG23 and earlier; UG24 and later can complete any elective)

Note that a student cannot both major in PPE and minor in Philosophy.
Economics

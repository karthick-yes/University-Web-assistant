This course is offered only to students who have studied psychology at a pre-college level and can then substitute for PSY 1001. The focus of the course is not on understanding introductory psychological concepts – we will barely cover any – but on building the skills necessary to think critically and scientifically like a psychologist.


Prerequisites: No Ashoka courses, but Psychology in Class 11, 12 in CBSC, IB and ISC boards. 


Offered: Recommended for Semester 2, but also offered every Monsoon and Spring.

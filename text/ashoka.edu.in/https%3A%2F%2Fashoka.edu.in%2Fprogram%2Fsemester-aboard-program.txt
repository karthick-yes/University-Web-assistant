Ashoka students can spend a maximum of one semester abroad at an international institution. Students take courses in their major and/or minor and transfer them to their undergraduate degree. Spending a semester abroad gives the students a prolonged experience in a different academic and cultural setting.
Popular destinations for a semester include King’s College London, Sciences Po, University of Geneva, Trinity College Dublin, University of British Columbia, Yale University, and more.
For more information, please contact the Office of International Programmes at .












“My semester at Yale was deeply enriching. The experience of studying abroad grounded my identity as an Indian — for the first time, I felt as though I was representing my people, a responsibility that I still struggle to fully understand, but which I treat with the greatest respect.” –

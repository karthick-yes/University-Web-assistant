Welcome to the world of broken pots, buried shipwrecks, and stolen idols. Conceptualized as an introductory course on the study of material remains from various parts of the world (with a strong emphasis on India), it is divided into two broad sections. The first explores fine-tuned methods employed by archaeologists to analyze available data in the reconstruction of the past; major theoretical turns in the history of the discipline; the relationship between history and archaeology; and the specialized branches of epigraphy and numismatics. The second section engages with scholarly but accessible accounts of archaeological cultures from Europe and Africa. While the first half of the course will be a combination of lectures and discussions, the remaining half will be completely discussed-based.

This course looks at economic development through the lens of food and agriculture. As we shall see, such a view can offer a powerful framework for understanding economic development outcomes. It is also productive in suggesting new lines of enquiry. The course covers modern literature relating to structural transformation, spatial distribution of economic activity, technology impacts, natural resources of water and land, and climate change.

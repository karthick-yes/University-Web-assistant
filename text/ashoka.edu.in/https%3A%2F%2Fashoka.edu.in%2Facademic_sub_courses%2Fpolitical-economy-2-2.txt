The course on political economy, broadly speaking, is a study of various political institutions in a democracy, behavior of citizens and politicians within these institutions, and the political and economic outcomes that emerge from their interactions. We will begin by studying various models of electoral competition and then move to discussing various institutional designs that shape electoral outcomes, namely electoral systems, voting technology, primaries etc. We will then examine some of the recurrent political issues that many countries face, namely elite capture, dynastic politics, gender and ethnic representation in politics and affirmative action, violence and politics etc. We will end by discussing how some of the historical political institutions have shaped modern political and economic outcomes.

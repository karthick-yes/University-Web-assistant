It is a remarkable fact that we can say some thing significant about a large variety of physical objects, ranging from black holes to a gas in an expanding ballon, without knowing anything about the constituents of the object. The aim of this course is to elucidate the laws that enables such a description and the conditions under which these laws are applicable. The laws are the laws of thermodynamics and the condition under which they apply is called the thermal equilibrium.

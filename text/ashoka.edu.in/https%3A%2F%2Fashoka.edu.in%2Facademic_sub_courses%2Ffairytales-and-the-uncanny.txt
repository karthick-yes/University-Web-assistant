Fairy tales have had a remarkable career, having been told and re-told, invented and re-invented by peasants,aristocrats, literary authors, and film studios. How have they beenappropriated and re-appropriated in oral traditions, print culture, andon the screen, and what has happened to the genre along the way? In thiscourse we will read and write about fairy tales from a variety ofhistorical and cultural contexts. In so doing, we will practice keyelements of writing in academic and non-academic contexts: developingand supporting a point, dialoguing with others, structuring a piece ofwritten work, etc. We will further consider how the fairy tale and itsconventions of magic, the supernatural, and the fantastic areappropriated into realist and so-called high literature, giving rise to anew aesthetic category: the uncanny.

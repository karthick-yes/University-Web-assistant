This is an advanced course in microeconomics. Knowledge of basic game theory will be assumed. The objective of this course is to equip the students with the tools to build and analyse models of strategic behaviour in environments with asymmetric information. We will then take these tools and apply them to study real life problems. Specific topics include Bayesian equilibrium, Sequential equilibrium, models of moral hazard and adverse selection, and applications to microfinance, media bias and advertising.

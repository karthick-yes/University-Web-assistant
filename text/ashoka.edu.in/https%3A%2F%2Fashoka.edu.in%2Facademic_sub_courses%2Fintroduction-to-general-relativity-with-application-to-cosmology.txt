Gravity is different, unlike other fundamental forces its description is not based on “charges” and “fields.” The best description of gravity is provided by the Gen- eral Theory of Relativity which is a theory of spacetime geometry. This theory not only provides a stunningly successful description of all known gravitational phenomenons, but is also a theory of immense beauty and sophistication. The main aim of this course is to introduce the fundamental concepts of General Theory of Relativity, a further aim is to apply it to modern cosmology


Pre-requisites: All core courses of year 1 and 2.


Books: The course will closely follow Gravity: An Introduction to Einstein’s General Relativity , by James B. Hartle

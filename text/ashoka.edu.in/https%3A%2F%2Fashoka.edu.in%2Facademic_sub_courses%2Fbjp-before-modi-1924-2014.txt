The course looks at 100 years of Hindu nationalism, from the 1920s to the present date. My recent book on the Jugalbandi: BJP Before Modi is required reading for the course, though there will be plenty of material that challenges my arguments. The course is divided into four parts: 1924-1980 (origins and the Jana Sangh); 1980-2014 (The BJP Before Modi); 2014-present day (the Modi era). While the book is interested in causal arguments, the mode of analysis will be largely historical.

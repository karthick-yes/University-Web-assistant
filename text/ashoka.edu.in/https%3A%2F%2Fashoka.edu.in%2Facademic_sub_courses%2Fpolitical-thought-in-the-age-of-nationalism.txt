This course will seek to explore notions of the state, nation, citizenship and other related concepts as they took root in 18th and 19th century Europe. It will then trace how these movements and ideas travelled to and took root in South Asia as well as in parts of the Middle East. This will allow students to not only understand the origins of today's 'dominant form of political representation'- the nation state-but will also give them an understanding of various nationalist and anti-colonial movements in the 19th century. Amongst others the works of Herder, Fichte, Mazzini, Mill, Jamaluddin Afghani, Tagore, Iqbal and Gandhi will be engaged with.

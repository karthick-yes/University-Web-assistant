Order-of-Magnitude Physics is a Critical Thinking Seminar in which simple examples will be used to illustrate the conceptual lenses through which a typical physicist looks at phenomena and the associations that arise naturally in her mind when she does that. In other words, students will learn to see the world through the eye of a physicist.


Students will be encouraged not to remember what they know but to re-examine it. A little knowledge of physics and mathematics may be helpful, but too much knowledge is likely to be a hindrance. Students will be required to solve problems and make presentations in the class.

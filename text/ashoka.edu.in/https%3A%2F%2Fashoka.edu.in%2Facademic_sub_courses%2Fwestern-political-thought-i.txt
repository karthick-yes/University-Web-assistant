What is good? What it Justice? Is evil permitted in the service of the state? This course examines some of the canonical texts of the Western Political Tradition that were significant in shaping thinking about the normative political theory. Through these texts it will range over a number of important questions: the nature of political obligation, the ends of life, the relationship between virtue and politics, the nature of justice, property rights, the nature of the state, the nature of the self. The emphasis will be to come to terms with important arguments in these areas, while also understanding these major texts in their own right.


This course equips you with the arguments and historical background for most of the debates in contemporary political thought as well.

The course will focus on issues related to Economic and Social networks.. The design of the course takes into account the fact that First year MA students will be studying game theory during this semester. Some elementary graph-theoretic concepts will also be used, but no prior knowledge will be assumed. The basic textbook for the course is


Matt Jackson : Social and Economic Networks


Students are also strongly recommended to browse through Jackson’s second book The Human Network. This is a non-technical discussion of many of the main topics of current research. I will also mention other references as we go along.


The main topics to be discussed are the following:


Introduction : why study networks; graph-theoretic concepts


Measures of centrality and Power


Strategic Network Formation


Games on Networks


Learning on networks


Diffusion


Networks in Some Specific Contexts

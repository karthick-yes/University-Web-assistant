Unlike quantitative research methods that are aimed at hypothesis-testing and generalization, qualitative methods aim to understand a phenomenon in a context-sensitive manner and help generate hypotheses. Here are just a handful of questions that you can answer using qualitative methods: How do Ashoka University students perceive their experiences in relations to Delhi University students? What was the impact of COVID on migrant workers? How are the experiences of upper-caste women different from that of Dalit women? How do employees at an organization perceive their bosses in corporate organizations? This course equips students with the theoretical as well as practical aspects of qualitative research in psychology.

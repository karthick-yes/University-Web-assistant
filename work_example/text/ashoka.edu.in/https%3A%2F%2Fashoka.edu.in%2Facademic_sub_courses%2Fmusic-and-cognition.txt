Music and Cognition is a survey course that will introduce students to key questions across topics of research interest in the field, including music and evolution, music and development, music and emotion, music and nonmusical cognitive abilities, performing and composing music, and listening to and liking music. The assessments will be a combination of MCQ tests taken over different points in the term and a collaborative project  where students will generate podcasts in small groups that they will receive ongoing feedback on.

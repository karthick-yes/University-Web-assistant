One of the three required courses for the English major, Early British Literature surveys texts and the cultural conditions of their production between, roughly, 700 and 1700 AD. Beginning with the Old English epic Beowulf and closing with the poetry of John Milton, the course affords a view of the many profound cultural changes and intercultural contacts that shape English literary history.

Starting with the question ‘Why do we call the Middle East, the Middle East?’ and ending with an overview of the recent trends in the politics of the region this course will introduce students to one of the most misunderstood parts of the world. The course is structured so that the intellectual trends, political currents and historical contexts of various countries will be mapped through primary sources as well as secondary readings. By the end of the course, students will be familiar with the main proponents, thinkers and ideologues of Political Islamism, Zionism and Arab nationalism amongst other such ‘isms.’

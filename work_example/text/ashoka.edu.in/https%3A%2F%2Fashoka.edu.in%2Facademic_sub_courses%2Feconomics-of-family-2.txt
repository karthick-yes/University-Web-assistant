In this course, we will use the economic principles to analyze decisions made within a family.


Topics include spousal labor supply, human capital, marriage, divorce, fertility and social mobility. We will then consider the macroeconomic implications of these family decisions. First, we will focus on short- and medium-run fluctuations and study how the changing demographic factors influence aggregate labor supply and savings. Next, we will discuss the importance of accounting for families in explaining inequality and as determinants of long-run economic development.


Prerequisites: ECO 2101 (Microeconomic Theory I), ECO 2202 (Macroeconomic Theory II), ECO 2400 (Econometrics)

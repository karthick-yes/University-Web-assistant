The rule of law is one of our most cherished political ideals. We refer to it routinely when, for example, we observe that we are ruled by laws rather than by people or when we say that no person is above the law. But what precisely does the “rule of law” mean? This course will address this question by considering a range of readings in political and legal theory. It will consider canonical interpretations and accounts of this ideal, such as those offered by thinkers like Dicey, Hayek, and Fuller. It will explore debates on the nature of the concept, such as whether it is a substantive or formal ideal, address how the rule of law relates to matters such as welfare and crime, and how it applies in the context of courts, emergencies, and so on.

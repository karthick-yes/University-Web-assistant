Do women talk more than men? Are Indians more interdependent than Americans? Does nutrition improve IQ? The answers to these questions and related ones are not absolute but statistical – they involve gathering data from a sample and then synthesizing the information using a relevant statistic to reach a conclusion. In this course, you will learn how to use statistical tools (central tendency, variability, probability, hypothesis testing, t-tests, ANOVA, regression, etc.) to answer questions of psychological interest. The emphasis is on understanding statistical concepts and performing basic statistical analyses, not on mathematical formulas and derivations.

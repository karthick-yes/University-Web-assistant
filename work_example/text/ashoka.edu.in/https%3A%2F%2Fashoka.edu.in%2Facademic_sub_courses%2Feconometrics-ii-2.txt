What is causal inference and how do we make causal inferences about data in the real world? This course builds on Econometrics I to cover more statistical methods, such as experiments, matching techniques, instrumental variables, differences-in-differences, and regression discontinuity design, with the explicit aim of measuring causal relationships using real-world data in Stata.

In the absence of any general framework (with no non-equilibrium analogue of entropy), there are several broad approaches to study non-equilibrium systems.  This course will discuss these general approaches like Langevin equation, Fokker-Planck formalism, Martin-Siggia-Rose field theory, master equation, Boltzmann equation, and hydrodynamics.  Some of the well-established results like the fluctuation-dissipation theorem, linear response theory, etc., will also be covered. Time permitting, a few specific model systems will be discussed, especially to introduce the idea of the renormalization group.

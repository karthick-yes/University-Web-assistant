Humans are social beings, and therefore, often identify with groups. These groups can be based on various social identities (e.g., religion, gender, sexual orientation, etc.) or they can be minimal groups (e.g., experimentally-assigned groups based on color of one's hat). This course introduces you to the psychological processes involved in how individuals, who are members of groups, think, feel, and behave towards other group members.

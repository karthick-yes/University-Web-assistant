Clubs and Societies












At Ashoka, when not occupied with academics, students will find themselves immersed in pursuing their hobbies and interests through clubs and societies! These will give students an ocean of opportunities to contribute and enrich their campus experience culturally and intellectually. Ranging from music, dance theatre, gaming, community engagement, creative writing, photography and much more, students may choose from amongst the array of existing clubs and societies functioning on campus, and also initiate their own! 
At Ashoka, clubs and societies are bodies that design their own leadership structure and modes of functioning. A ‘Club’ is a focused group working towards a specific field of interest. A ‘Society’ is an umbrella organization which has under it two or more clubs. These clubs have diverse interests and pursuits with a common objective and focal interest area that affiliates them to a single domain and binds them together.

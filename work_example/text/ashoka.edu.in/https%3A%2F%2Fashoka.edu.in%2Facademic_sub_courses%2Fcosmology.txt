The aim of cosmology is to apply laws of physics to the universe as a whole. Observations tell us that the universe is neither eternal nor static, and therefore it raises questions as to when and how did the universe start? What did it look like in the past? How will it evolve in the future? Aim of this course is to use all the physics that you have learned as an undergraduate to try and answer these questions.


The student will have a fairly deep understanding the origin and evolution of the universe, and will be exposed to outstanding unsolved problems.

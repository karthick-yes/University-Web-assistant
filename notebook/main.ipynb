    "# RAG Implementation Comparison: Custom vs. LangChain\n",
    "\n",
    "## Overview\n",
    "\n",
    "In this notebook, I've implemented two versions of Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG):\n",
    "\n",
    "1. A custom implementation built from scratch\n",
    "2. An implementation using LangChain\n",
    "\n",
    "## Key Findings\n",
    "\n",
    "### Custom Implementation\n",
    "- Built entirely from scratch\n",
    "- Offers more control over the process\n",
    "- Resulted in a more manageable size for Lambda deployment\n",
    "\n",
    "### LangChain Implementation\n",
    "- Utilized the LangChain library for RAG\n",
    "- Provided pre-built components and easier setup\n",
    "- Resulted in significantly larger deployment size\n",
    "\n",
    "## Deployment Challenges\n",
    "\n",
    "When attempting to deploy these implementations to AWS Lambda, I encountered notable differences:\n",
    "\n",
    "- **Custom Implementation**: Successfully deployed within Lambda's size limits\n",
    "- **LangChain Implementation**: Faced size-related errors during deployment\n",
    "\n",
    "### Note on Multiple Layers\n",
    "While I'm aware of the possibility of using multiple layers in Lambda to accommodate larger dependencies, this approach provided minimal improvements for the LangChain implementation. The size reduction was not significant enough to justify the added complexity of managing multiple layers.\n",
    "\n",
    "## Conclusion\n",
    "\n",
    "For my use case, the custom RAG implementation proved more suitable for Lambda deployment due to its smaller size footprint. While LangChain offers convenience and pre-built components, its size makes it challenging to deploy in serverless environments like Lambda without significant compromises.\n",
    "\n",
    "The trade-off between development ease (LangChain) and deployment simplicity (custom implementation) is evident. For Lambda-based deployments, the custom approach appears to be more practical and cost-effective in the long run."

Overview 1.1 Degree Requirements at Ashoka To graduate with a Bachelor’s degree, students are required to pass courses that are broadly divided into three categories – Foundation Courses ,Major Courses (including Interdisciplinary Majors) andCo-Curricular Courses . First year students typically take foundation courses in the ﬁrst 3-4 semesters at Ashoka, and start taking Major courses from the 2nd semester. You also have the option to take up a completely different subject as a minor or a concentration in addition to your major. Minors and Concentrations are brief programs taken in disciplines other than your major. Minors at Ashoka require you to take 6 courses in a discipline, while a concentration requires 4 courses. 1.2 GPA and Credit System Please note that University-wise credit requirements are subject to change, and the latest requirements are always available on the ofﬁcial website . At Ashoka, each course carries credit points - foundation courses as well as major speciﬁc and minor courses typically earn a student 4 credit points , while co-curricular courses give 2 credit points . In order to earn their degree at the end of three years, students pursuing a pure major (such as Computer Science etc.) need to have accumulated a minimum of 100 credits . On the other hand, students pursuing an interdisciplinary major (such as CS and Entrepreneurship etc.) must fulﬁll a minimum of116 credits . A student’s performance in any academic course is graded on a letter scale (ranging from A to F). Each grade carries a grade point (such as an A gives 16 grade points, while an A- gives 14.8). On this basis, at the end of every semester a student’s cumulative grade point average (CGPA) and semester speciﬁc GPA are calculated. For more on this, please refer to the section on Awards and Recognition (3.6).6 Chapter 1. Overview 1.3 CS at Ashoka The Department of Computer Science at Ashoka University acknowledges the increasing relevance of computing and information science to every academic discipline. In addition to classical and emerging areas of Computer Science, students have an opportunity to study interdisciplinary areas like computational biology, social and information networks, digital humanities and data-driven journalism. 2 interdisciplinary majors, a minor, a concentration are also offered by the Department in addition to an undergraduate major in Computer Science and a Ph.D. in Computer Science. The goals of the programme include (but are not limited to): 1.Impart a deep understanding of the foundations of Computer Science 2.Enable a student to be able to systematically apply the foundational knowledge across disci- plines 3.Create new knowledge in the ﬁeld of Computer Science 1.3.1 Programs Offered •Undergraduate –Major –Interdisciplinary Major –Advanced Major–Minor –Concentration •PhD •Graduate Assistantship 1.3.2 Faculty and Research Interests •Ravi Kothari , Professor (HOD Com- puter Science) Machine Learning, Pattern Recognition, Data Mining and Big Data •Sudheendra Hangal , Professor of the Practice in Computer Science Human- Computer Interaction, Social Media and Personal Digital Archives •Manu Awasthi , Associate Professor Com- puter Architecture, Operating Systems, and Computers & Society •Anirban Mondal , Associate Professor Ur- ban Informatics (Smart Cities), Spatial Databases and Financial Analytics •Mahavir Jhawar , Assistant ProfessorCryptography, Block-chain and Network Security •Debayan Gupta , Assistant Professor Se- cure Computation, Cryptography, and Pri- vacy •Goutam Paul , Associate Professor (Visit- ing - Spring 2020, Monsoon 2018) Cryp- tology, Security, Information and Coding Theory, Quantum Information and Compu- tation •Subhash Bhalla , Professor (Visiting - Monsoon 2020, Spring 2021) Distributed Database Systems, New Query Languages For a complete list of all faculty (core and visiting) and PhD students pursuing CS at Ashoka, visit thedepartmental website .2.

Academic Opportunities 3.1 Complimentary Disciplines Computer Science is a very versatile subject - with applications transcending multiple disciplines. At Ashoka, we have 2 interdisciplinary courses in CS, along with Entrepreneurship and Mathematics. Apart from these, it is also common for students studying CS at Ashoka to enroll in courses from Mathematics, Economics, Physics and Biology. 3.2 Study Abroad Programs Note that, like any other program at Ashoka, the Study Abroad Programs are subject to changes. Kindly refer to the GESP website for the latest information. Additionally, contact the departmental HOD for further clariﬁcation regarding credit transfers Every summer, international summer schools offer undergraduate courses in different subjects and ﬁelds. These courses can be transferred (subject to faculty approval) to the total credits taken as Ashoka. The Ofﬁce of Global Education and Strategic Programmes (GESP) is available to students for assistance and counselling in the application process. Ashoka is currently partnered with Wellesley College, UC Berkeley, University of Pennsyl- vania, Yale University, King’s College London, University of Michigan, Penn Engineering, Sciences Po, and Trinity College Dublin . Students can also apply for research and internship opportunities abroad to get practical experience in their ﬁelds of interest through a competitive process. These opportunities are available in Lehigh University, NTU Singapore, Koç University etc. For any enquiries on the process of applying for a summer/semester abroad, kindly email studyabroad@ashoka.edu.in 3.3 Teaching Assistantships As a TF/TA, you would be responsible for grading quizzes, holding discussion sessions and doubt clearing ofﬁce hours, as well as helping with the logistics for classes. A prospective applicant can12 Chapter 3. Academic Opportunities apply to TA for only those courses which they have already studied in Ashoka in the past. While preference may be given to seniors, anyone is welcome to apply for TAship by approaching the professor directly. Some courses may have different procedures, so do conﬁrm it with the instructor. 3.4 Independent Study Modules (ISM) Independent Study Modules (ISM) are 4-credit research projects that provide students an opportunity to work closely with a faculty member. These projects can either be research that faculty members are already working on or any other research topic that students may be interested in. If interested, you can simply approach a faculty member through email prior to the start of the semester, requesting them for guidance through an ISM. These count towards your electives. 3.5 Research Opportunities with Professors If you are interested in CS Research, it is a great idea to start working as a Research Assistant (RA) under a faculty member. In order to do so, you will have to personally approach faculty members in their ofﬁce hours and enquire whether you can assist them on current projects. Before seeking RA roles, make sure to have prior knowledge about the research interests of your faculty member. The CS Society also has plans of creating a uniﬁed Undergraduate Research Opportunities Platform to ease out this process. 3.6 Awards and Recognition •Dean’s List: The Dean’s List at Ashoka for any given semester includes the names of all students who, in the courses they have taken that semester, have scored a GPA of 3.65 or above. The Dean’s List is awarded on a semester basis. •Latin Honors: Students who have achieved scholastic distinction may be awarded the bach- elor’s degree with Latin honors at graduation. Honors appear on the ofﬁcial transcript and diploma. The criteria for these honors is as follows: 1.Cum Laude (With Distinction) - GPA >3.6 2.Magna Cum Laude (With High Distinction) - GPA >3.75 3.Summa Cum Laude (With Highest Distinction) - GPA >3.9 •Academic Achievement Awards: Gold Silver and Bronze Awards are awarded respectively to the students attaining the Top 3 Major CGPAs during graduation. •Undergraduate Research Excellence Awards: Awarded to the graduating student with the best track record in academic research, evaluated on the basis of publications and thesis quality. •Service Excellence Awards: Awarded for extraordinary service in department building through various activities..4. CS Clubs and Societies 4.1 CS Society The Computer Science Society at Ashoka University was founded in 2016 to strengthen the emerging CS culture on campus. It is an academic society that aims to create opportunities and resources for all students interested in this ﬁeld through a host of activities.

CS Clubs and Societies 4.2 Women in Computing Society (WiCS) Founded by an Ashoka alumnus, Simran Bhuria, and launched on campus by Mrs. Rashmi Mohan, an ACM eminent speaker on 29th September 2016, Women in Computing Society is a small bunch of passionate students working towards making the CS culture at Ashoka a safer, healthier, and inclusive one. We also focus on supporting everyone in CS, especially womxn, academically and personally. We constantly work towards building a larger community of womxn in CS that is collaborative and supportive in nature. As an academic society, we organise talks, hackathons, cryptic hunts, workshops, problem-solving centered stalls and events, and reading groups. As a part of our larger vision of an inclusive community, we organise events focused on activism – blog posts, discussions on gender in academic spaces and sexism, sessions on building conﬁdence and tackling other challenges for womxn in STEM and movie screenings! 1.WiCS cryptic hunts: We have had multiple hunts since the inception of WiCS based on different themes in collaboration with other societies such as – Ashoka’s Philosophy Society, Ashoka’s Psychology Society, Sandhi (Ashoka’s Languages Society), Ashoka Society for Politics, etc. 2.Workshops: These are focused on tools and skills useful for students in CS and beyond. We have done workshops on Git, web development, programming for beginners (Programming without Code), Excel/Google Sheets etc. 3.Interactive sessions: Some of the sessions we have organised in the past: a session with Prof. Jennifer Widom, Stanford University at Ashoka (2018), a Capstone Student Panel Discussion with senior students and alumni, an open house for CS students focused on discussions around gender in academic spaces, mixers for CS womxn. 4.Problem-solving centered stalls at fests and Haats: These were our attempts at sharing the joy of solving puzzles and love for algorithms with others at Ashoka. 5.Hackathons, collaborative work sessions focused on competitive programming, and unwinding sessions. Reach out to us at wics@ashoka.edu.in. 4.3 Special CS Events •CS Mixer: The CS Mixer is a unique initiate undertaken by the Department of CS every year, intended primarily to introduce the CS freshers to the seniors and members of the faculty. It is a fun event where you get to interact with all the faculty members, seek quick advice, all while enjoying free food! •Mahavamsa: Mahavamsa is Ashoka’s ﬁrst coding contest. It is a 48 hour coding contest with lots of cash prizes to be won. The contest is open to all current students of Ashoka University. Beginners and non-CS majors are also encouraged to participate. All you need is basic programming knowledge in a language of your choice! The ﬁrst edition of Mahavamsa was held in Spring 2020 and the CS Society intends to make it a recurring event.5.

Computer Science, goes the joke (hint: they’re not joking), has little to do with com- puters and is not really a science. If you really push me, I’d say that it is a study of processes, of understanding why and how things happen, and their inherent complexity: is one problem truly harder than another? E.g., is it more difﬁcult to ﬁnd a square root than a 3rd root? Why? (Maybe there’s an easy trick for one and we’re just being stupid.) Personally, I love this subject because it’s the closest thing to magic we have. We create our incantations (computer programs), prepare the appropriate sacriﬁces (sleep is the common currency used by undergraduates, I believe), and wave our wands (or macbooks dual-booting linux): our spells can travel across the world across the only planetary-scale infrastructure ever built by humanity, jumping across chains of electrons and photons in a system that stores (nearly) the sum total of human knowledge (and ignorance). Our spells can analyse your iris and detect diabetes well before any medical doctor could, and also tell the hospital how to best optimise their supplies; they can navigate our spacecraft across unimaginable distances and help us understand the universe; they can connect us all through social media and buoy industry through a pandemic via e-commerce. There’s a dark side as well - all things can be misused. I hope to teach you a lot about computer science. But I don’t just want well-trained worker bees: I want brilliant, nuanced thought; I want technical knowledge balanced by moral ﬁbre; but most of all, I want each and every one of you to become the very best human beings you can be (that, and understand pointers properly). PS. Yes, computer scientists tend to use more parentheses than most other people (and what’s wrong with that?). -Debayan Gupta , Assistant Professor, Ashoka University5.3 Post-Ashoka Journey 17 5.2.2 Book/ Resource Recommendation Textbooks/ Reference books recommended by Faculty: 1.Introduction to Algorithms by Cormen, Leiserson, Rivest, and Stein 2.The C Programming Language by Kernighan and Ritchie 3.The C++ Programming Language by Bjarne Stroustrup 4.Database System Concepts by Avi Silberschatz 5.Computational Complexity: A Modern Approach by Barak and Arora 6.Introduction to Modern Cryptography by Katz and Lindell 7.Cryptography and Network Security by Stallings 8.Compilers: Principles, Techniques, and Tools by Aho, Lam, Sethi, and Ullman 9.Artiﬁcial Intelligence: A Modern Approach by Norvig and Russell 10.Computer Networks by Tanenbaum 11.Computer Architecture: A Quantitative Approach by Hennessy and Patterson 12.Modern Processor Design by Shen and Lipasti Other fun reads: 1.Gödel, Escher, Bach by Douglas Hofstadter 2.I am a Strange Loop by Douglas Hofstadter 3.The Art of Computer Programming by Donald E.

Ashoka University offers a 3-month long summer break, which you can utilize productively by interning. It is advisable to search for summer internships at least 2-3 months prior to the start of the break - most ﬁrms or research centers have deadlines that you should research about as early as possible. Moreover, Ashoka University’s Career Development Ofﬁces (CDO) also provide internship opportunities through ﬁrms that recruit interns on campus. If you’re applying through CDO, keep your SuperSet proﬁle updated to avoid last-minute hassle. For CS speciﬁc internships, do occasionally brush up on your Data Structures and Algorithms . 5.3.2 On Letters of Recommendation from Faculty Graduation School applications often require letters of recommendation from faculty during the admissions process. An optimal letter-writer should ideally have you in at least one class or should have supervised you in research, thesis, or other work. Moreover, their contact with you should be relatively recent. You might also want to consider how well you performed in their class or work and whether you have had interactions with them outside of the classroom. Note that different professors may have different rules related to Letters of Recommendation, thus make it a point to get in touch with your desired letter-writer and clarify all details well in advanced. Also, approach the faculty at least 2 weeks in advanced for them to be prepared.18 Chapter 5. Additional Resources and Advice 5.3.3 Alumni Experiences in the Industry Barun Parruck (UG’19) Q:What does your current role at Google India entail? A:I’m a Software Engineer 2 at Google, speciﬁcally an iOS full stack developer within the Google One team. My day to day work involves ﬁxing bugs assigned to me, proposing and implementing new features, and writing unit tests for these features. Q:You were active on competitive programming websites. How helpful do you think that was in helping you secure an internship at Microsoft and the subsequent job offer? A:They were perhaps the main feature of how I got the internship. Getting the job offer from the internship was a completely different task, and primarily involved making extensive contributions to their codebase and presenting and demo’ing my additions constantly over the period of the internship. Q:During your time at Ashoka, what were your favorite courses? Other than Program- ming, what area of CS intrigued you the most? A:Software Debugging is probably the most useful course I’ve ever taken. Most of my interest lies in either algorithmic problem solving or full stack web development and software architecture. My favourite course was Databases and Data Mining (Debapriyo Majumdar), followed closely by Computer Organization and Systems (Vivek Seshadri) Q:Any pitfalls one should avoid while studying CS at Ashoka? A:Avoid taking too many courses (though deﬁnitely attend a single class of every single course, just in case you’re missing out on some exceptional professors). I think a lot of people get caught up with the idea that the goal is the submission of the assignment. I’ve had bad grades now and then - but I’ve tried my best to make sure that every assignment submitted wasn’t for the submission but for the content. And start early! :P Q:What advice would you give to undergraduates who wish to join the industry? A:Deﬁnitely I’d say you need to focus on getting your interviews right. I seem to do pretty well in traditional SWE interviews and a large part of that comes from my competitive programming background, as well as just grinding leetcode and practicing mock interviews a lot. If you don’t interview often, it’s quite likely that stress will act up and cause you to perform subpar. And reach out to seniors, professors, anybody - connections are important in the industry re: getting referrals. Participate in all the popular company recruitment drives like the Facebook Hacker cup, or the Google Code jam/kickstarter. And ﬁnally, you can always reach out to recruiters on Linkedin if you’ve got a decent proﬁle to be able to bring a more personal touch to the applications you make Barun Parruck is a Software Engineer at Google Inc. He was formerly a Software Engineer at Microsoft where he had also interned in his junior year. As a student, Barun was very active on competitive programming websites like Codeforces5.3 Post-Ashoka Journey 19 Nishka Dasgupta (ASP’19) Q:What does your current role at Microsoft Research Lab, India entail? A:I work as a Research Fellow. Under the guidance of my manager, I am currently trying to develop efﬁcient protocols in Multiparty Computation (MPC). Q:What do you think, helped you secure your current role? A:Both my previous summer internships had been research-focused, speciﬁcally on cryptography projects, so that certainly played a factor. By fortunate coincidence, my most recent internship before I applied had been in multiparty computation (MPC), and the manager whom I applied to work with was also interested in MPC at the time, so our research interests aligned. Having strong recommendations also helped. Q:How should one prepare for job/internship searches? A:While not every role will have the same requirements, there are some general best practises that have helped me. Cover your bases before any interview or exam; a lot of interviews, even for speciﬁc roles, often expect a breadth of basic knowledge anyway. Be prepared to network and ﬁnd out which of your professors (especially professors who have a positive impression of you) knows someone who knows someone who works at your dream company/university. Talk to your seniors, batchmates and professors as well, to learn about opportunities you would not have heard of otherwise (that’s how I learned about the RF programme at MSR). Don’t take rejection personally; focus on learning from your mistakes. Try not to bluff too hard about your interest or knowledge regarding any ﬁeld/professor unless you are prepared to put in the work until you really are as dedicated/knowledgeable as you claimed to be. Q:Any pitfalls one should avoid while studying CS at Ashoka? A:As most of the professors don’t really impose a speciﬁc language, it can be easy to get too comfortable with only one language. This is a mistake. Look for excuses to learn new languages or frameworks that you are not being forced to learn in a class, especially those popularly used in your preferred ﬁeld (e.g most big crypto projects are written in C/C++) or in the industry at large. Python is delightful up until your job interviewer asks you questions about memory errors in C. Although mathematics courses are not compulsory for CS at Ashoka, some ﬁelds (and grad schools) will expect certain courses (e.g a Linear Algebra requirement for AI focused programmes; a Number Theory requirement for theoretical crypto). If you have a preferred ﬁeld, do your research on what is needed (talk to relevant professors too) and plan your courses accordingly. Q:Any advice for undergraduates about the Industry? A:Long working hours are, unfortunately, the norm, whether in research or in development. Especially near deadlines, sleep can be hard to come by. So, start working on your ability to handle stress. In research speciﬁcally, you will often be expected to take the lead and start making suggestions instead of waiting for your mentor to tell you what to do next; if you have trouble with that, start practising. Nishka is a Research Fellow at Microsoft Research Labs, India. She has interned at Nanyang Technlogical University - Singapore, and Tata Institute of Fundamental Research - Mumbai, as an undergraduate researcher.20 Chapter 5. Additional Resources and Advice 5.3.4 Alumni Experiences in Higher Education Anavi Kajla (ASP’18) Q:You pursued your Masters in Human-Computer Interaction. How good a ﬁeld, in your opinion, is HCI for someone who wants to study Computer Science in sync with the Humanities? A:HCI is a highly interdisciplinary ﬁeld and can draw from virtually any discipline. A degree in CS and then going into HCI is highly beneﬁcial because you have a deeper understanding of software development and various technical constraints. Ultimately, any job in UX will involve a high degree of communicating with developers about the designs you create and knowing how they work gives you an advantage. Q:You have also interned at Amazon. What skills do such companies look for while hiring students who specialize in UI/UX? Do Data Structure and Algorithm skills take prece- dence? Or are Software Engineers who work on UI/UX projects evaluated differently? A:There are 4 paths someone interested in UI/UX can take: UX Designer, UX Engineer, Visual Designer and UX Researcher. Skills & evaluation depends on which role you’re interested in and usually doesn’t require knowledge of CS concepts we’re taught in our major. I would highly recommend looking up these specializations for a more in-depth understanding of what each role entails and where your interests/strengths lie. There are skills common to all these that employers typically look for: a portfolio of projects (super important!), storytelling skills, creative problem-solving and the ability to communicate well with others. In my case, I was exclusively an SDE and didn’t have much of a UI/UX component in my internship apart from working on a small front-end project. Q:What parameters would you advise an undergrad at Ashoka to focus on, if they wish to pursue graduate studies in Human-Computer Interaction? A:Since most CS classes at Ashoka have a project component in them, it would be beneﬁcial if students could go and talk to actual users of the product they’re building and get feedback on it! This would help them understand the importance/role of UX in product development and also, make for a great portfolio project. Apart from that, getting familiar with various prototyping tools (eg. Sketch, Figma) is a great place to start developing interaction & visual design skills. Some of these tools also offer students free plans! And, front-end skills are a bonus too. Q:Are there any pitfalls one should avoid while studying CS at Ashoka? A:The Ashoka CS department has grown a lot since I graduated and students should take advantage of the variety of classes offered to develop their interests. When I was attending, my batchmates & I would take whichever course was offered so we could complete our major! It didn’t afford us the ﬂexibility to take classes that we were genuinely interested in. Apart from one introductory HCI class in my second year, I wasn’t able to study more topics in the ﬁeld. But now hopefully you can!5.3 Post-Ashoka Journey 21 Q:What advice would you give to undergraduates who wish to eventually join the industry in a similar ﬁeld? A: –Try to involve users in your class projects early to get a feel of the work you’ll be doing as a UXer –Working on a portfolio takes time, so start early! (look here for inspiration) –Research the ﬁeld and it’s many specializations well before you decide to take the leap - it’s not for everyone Anavi is currently a product designer at the Library of Congress - USA. She pursued her Masters in Human Computer Interaction from the University of Maryland-College Park. She has also interned at Amazon as a Software Development Engineer Pratyush Ranjan Tiwari (ASP’20) Q:What are your current research interests? A:My main research area of interest is cryptography. My areas of interests within cryptography are veriﬁable computation, quantum cryptography, privacy-preserving techniques and funda- mentals of cryptography. I am particularly interested in designing protocols with minimal trust requirements. Q:What undergraduate research that you have undertaken are you the proudest of? A:Two main projects: a) Is the paper I published at IEEE Security and Privacy on the Blockchain titled CryptoWills, which is a protocol for secure and private last wills for cryptocurrencies. This allows for people’s funds in cryptocurrencies to be distributed to their loved ones after they passed away, this is a ﬁrst protocol solving that problem. b) Security & Privacy and attacks on Aadhaar: I worked on this with a big team of people at Ashoka under Prof. Debayan Gupta. My personal contribution was towards the cryptography used in Aadhaar, I devised the biggest attack on Aadhaar till date. The paper is embargoed and we are awaiting govt. permission to publish. Q:Any pitfalls one should avoid while studying CS at Ashoka? A:Don’t do things because other people think they’re cool. Find out for yourself if working for a big tech company will actually be your dream job. Since Ashoka is new and we don’t really get the FAANG companies to visit and hire, people at Ashoka CS often develop this fantasy for such jobs. Do internships to ﬁgure out what a career in a particular direction is like, do an internship with some startup in Bangalore/some other city in India (and abroad too if you can) to ﬁnd out what it’s like living that life. Intern at a university in India (and abroad too if you can) to ﬁgure out what life in academia is like. Bottomline, whatever possible career trajectories you want to try out, do that a lot, even if it costs you some grades (tbh, don’t drop below 3.5 tho).Start looking for internships for the next summer from August, ask professors to connect you with people. After the summer before 4th year you can basically have a plan then on what to do next. Finding jobs/grad schools etc. will take a year and thats’ what the22 Chapter 5. Additional Resources and Advice 4th year is for. Try different dept. at Ashoka and their courses, doing interdisciplinary things opens new doors career wise. Only work with people you enjoy working with. Don’t fall into the classic CS stereotype, and be healthy, well rounded and don’t let your major be your identity. Q:How should one prepare for Grad School applications? A:Once you know you’re applying the most important aspects are 1.Published papers/pre-prints : Pre-prints are fully written papers which are not yet accepted for publishing. This is the easiest foot-in-the-door from the perspective of admission committees. If you don’t have this yet, I would suggest getting at least a pre-print worthy research idea, working on it and then applying. 2.Recommendation: Only ask people who will recommend you 110% positively, make you look awesome. Try to get someone very successful in your research area/ﬁeld to write a rec, this person should be preferably from outside Ashoka. The way to do this is to get internships with people like this and then working super hard to impress them. 3.Grades: Sorry but yes, the higher your grades the better your chances in general. However, everything above a 3.8 is the same. The big brackets I would say are a) 3.8+ b) 3.5+ c) 3.2+ d) apply later. In case of d) do something awesome to stand out, like publish a paper at a top venue to stand out, work somewhere popular, get a recommendation from someone who is super popular in the ﬁeld and only then apply. Or go to an okayish place for a Master’s and then improve. Q:Any advice for undergraduates about the higher studies in CS? A:If you haven’t done any research, then don’t go to grad school. Only go to grad school if you’ve worked on research problems, and know that you want to take advanced courses and also do more research. Don’t go if you’re unsure/ because don’t have anything else lined up. Ideally you should pay 0 for grad school, and arguably go only when you don’t have to pay. Pratyush is a passionate cryptographer, pursuing his PhD from John Hopkins University. He was also accepted to NYU’s Courant School of Mathematics. His internship experience includes research roles at Indian Institute of Technology-Madras, Chennai Mathematical Institute, Dunya Labs, and Celo-Berlin.5.3 Post-Ashoka Journey 23 Vineet Reddy (ASP’20) Q:You were accepted to some very reputed departments like NYU Tandon and UChicago. What path did you tread as an undergraduate that helped you secure these? A:I think having a solid research/project experience in your undergrad really sets you apart from other students. Keep in mind that Ashoka CS still does not have the same reputation as that of other programs in India (think IIT’s IIIT’s and BITS). I think focusing on this can be really useful when one is applying to graduate programs. Also, developing good rapport with your professors helps as you’ll need their references when you start applying. Q:According to you, what sets someone apart when applying to universities for a Masters in CS? A:From what our professors have told me - SoP and your LoRs seem to matter, by far, the most. While your GPA is important, most of the time, it your SoP and LoRs that set you apart from every other applicant. Stufﬁng them with solid references and good content should really help. Q:What is the next ’big’ thing you aspire to achieve? A:Ideally, work as a Software Developer in one of the Big 4 tech companies. Something long term would be to retire as soon as possible! Trust me, slogging off at work sucks. Q:Any pitfalls one should avoid while studying CS at Ashoka? A:One of the biggest pitfalls I noticed coming from an engineering program was how the education for most CS majors ends with the classroom. Most of the stuff I picked up was by doing random side projects and messing around with some popular libraries. Don’t just do what your courses tell you to, pick up random stuff and just work on it – you’ll probably learn a lot more than what your courses teach. Q:Any advice for undergraduates about the higher studies in CS? A:Work hard in Discrete Math and Algorithms! They’re super important courses that I should have paid a lot more attention to. Don’t worry too much about your grades, they’ll be ﬁne as long as you put in a bit of effort. Don’t just be a one trick pony – learn more than Python. Most of all, enjoy your time at Ashoka, it’s going to be great. Vineet is a Machine Learning Enthusiast, and was accepted to Masters programs at the New York University, University of Chicago, University of Massachusetts Amherst, and University of Maryland. Due to the ongoing COVID-19 crisis, he has decided to defer his admit to the next year. He’s currently working as a software development engineer at EACIIT - a Singapore based Big Data Analytics leader.24 Chapter 5. Additional Resources and Advice Aditya Singh (ASP’20) Q:What is the most important advice you would give juniors who wish to get into top Masters programs? A:I think the most important thing is to actively engage with the material and faculty while taking courses. Before making the decision to apply for further studies, it’s important to be clear about what one would like to study further. Personally, being involved in various different projects helped me in identifying the areas I really wanted to focus on and pursue further. Q:According to you, which aspect of your application was most instrumental in you getting accepted into top universities? A:Applying for postgraduate studies is a pretty holistic process so pinpointing one single aspect is difﬁcult. I think having industry exposure along with some research experience is helpful as it shows versatility, which then also reﬂects in the recommendations. Doing decently well on standardized tests is essential as they act as a virtual cutoff for some universities. The statement of purpose is also as important as anything else and should be thoroughly reviewed. Q:Any pitfalls one should avoid while studying CS at Ashoka? A:I can’t say in general, but in my experience, I found that it’s easy to become a little disconnected and solely grade obsessed at Ashoka, which is a detrimental mindset to have. Making the effort to interact and grow with not only your professors, but also your peers, goes a long way in helping you get the most out of the time you spend here. Q:How would you compare research experience and industry internships when it comes to applying to Masters programs in grad schools? A:I think it really depends on the sort of programs and universities one is targeting. For more theoretical and research-based programs I emphasized my research experience with professors at Ashoka and outside, whereas for programs that are also directed towards the industry (like data science, information systems, etc.) I put more emphasis on the internships. The recommendation letters also varied correspondingly. Again, it’s helpful to identify the area one would like to pursue, and plan the summer/winter commitments accordingly. Q:As you will be studying Computational Data Science at CMU, what is the most impor- tant skill people interested in Data Science must cultivate? A:I think the most important skill to cultivate would be to keep your fundamentals in mathematics strong, especially in subjects like linear algebra and real analysis. One might be able to intuitively understand how CNNs look for features across visual data, but knowing how the process of Stochastic Gradient Descent works is as important.

The general syntax of one’s email is <ﬁrstname>.<lastname>_<batch>@ashoka.edu.in and you can use this format to look up/ contact anyone at Ashoka. Keep in mind that if one has multiple active email addresses, you will need to use your discretion, as follows: –If one has separate aspandugemails, contact them on their latest email (i.e aspin this case). Similarly, contact alumni on their alumni email ID. –Contact your TAs and TFs on their TA IDs, and not their personal emails, for course- related queries - makes their lives easier •If you do now know who to contact for anything remotely related to Computer Science, you should probably contact the CS Representative ﬁrst.

Studies show that the majority of innovative products and services in an economy evolve from entrepreneurial ventures. By providing knowledge and skills important to the creation and leadership of such startups, the Entrepreneurship Concentration within the Computer Science Program at Ashoka University will aim to train the founders and leaders of tomorrow’s high-tech ventures. The program is designed specifically for students who want to be tech-entrepreneurs. Courses are approached from the perspective of the student whose primary interest is in technological innovation, whose primary concentration is on science courses, and who has little or no prior business education.  The curriculum structure for the Bachelor’s Degree programme in Computer Science and Entrepreneurship follows that of the University’s standard undergraduate programme curriculum structure. To earn a Bachelor’s degree, each student will be required to complete a total of 28 courses over the programme period of 3 years of 2 semesters each. The programme will require 16 courses in the major papers/subjects. Foundational papers/subjects will constitute the remaining coursework for the student, adding up to 12 courses.     Introduction to Computer Programming is the first course in our series introducing students to computer science. In this class you will learn the fundamentals of computer programming in Java, with emphasis on applications in science and engineering. You will also learn about the broader field of computer science and algorithmic thinking, the fundamental approach that computer scientists take to solving problems. This course tightly integrates the theory and applications of discrete probability, discrete stochastic processes, and discrete statistical inference in the study of computer science. The course will introduce the Minimum Description Length Paradigm to unite basic ideas about randomness, inference and computation. Students will be expected to use the Maple programming environment in homework exercises which will include numerical and symbolic computations, simulations, and graphical displays. This course focuses on advanced topics in modern computer architecture, illustrated by recent case studies. Topics include fundamentals of quantitative analysis; pipelined, out-of-order, and speculative execution; superscalar, VLIW and vector processors; embedded processors; memory hierarchy design; thread-level parallelism; multiprocessors and multi-core architectures, synchronization and cache coherence protocols. This course introduces some of the formal tools of computer science, using a variety of applications as a vehicle. You’ll learn how to encode data so that when you scratch the back of a DVD, it still plays just fine; how to distribute “shares” of your floor’s PIN so that any five of you can withdraw money from the floor bank account (but no four of you can); how to play chess; and more. Topics that we’ll explore along the way include: logic and proofs, number theory, elementary complexity theory and recurrence relations, basic probability, counting techniques, and graphs. Design and implementation of operating systems. Topics include process synchronization and interprocess communication, processor scheduling, memory management, virtual memory, interrupt handling, device management, I/O, and file systems. Hands-on study of Linux operating system design and kernel internals, including work with Android devices. Experience with commercial virtualization tools and open source software. This course is an introduction to models of computation, computability, and complexity. We will ask questions like: How do we define the abstract notion of “computation” or a “computer”? What problems can be computed? What problems can be computed efficiently? Can we prove that some problems can never be computed, no matter how fast our computers become? The course is highly mathematical and abstract; in particular, there will be minimal programming assignments (if any) and homework problems will frequently involve proving or disproving various assertions. Students are expected to be comfortable with the material covered in Discrete Math or the equivalent. Topics (not exhaustive): automata and the languages they define, context-free grammars and the languages they define, Turing machines, basic complexity theory (such as P vs. NP). Complete data structures and algorithms course. The course teaches the following topics : Objects and ADTs, Constructors and destructors, Data Structure , Methods, Pre- and post-conditions C conventions, Error Handling, Arrays, Lists, Stacks, Stack Frames, Recursion, Sequential Searches, Binary Search , Trees, Complexity, Queues, Priority Queues , Heaps, Bubble , Heap Sort, Quick Sort , Bin Sort, Radix Sort, Searching Revisited, Red-Black trees, AVL trees, General n-ary trees, Hash Tables, Dynamic Algorithms, Fibonacci Numbers , Binomial Coefficients, Optimal Binary Search Trees, Matrix Chain Multiplication, Longest Common Subsequence, Optimal Triangulation , Graphs , Minimum Spanning Tree , Dijkstra’s Algorithm , Huffman Encoding , FFT , Hard or Intractable Problems, Eulerian or Hamiltonian Paths , Travelling Salesman’s Problem. How do you optimally encode a text ?le? How do you ?nd shortest paths in a map? How do you desgin a communication network? How do you route data in a network? What are the limits of ef?cient computation? This course gives a comprehensive introduction to design and analysis of algorithms, and answers along the way to these and many other interesting computational questions. You will learn about problem-solving; advanced data structures such as universal hashing and red-black trees; advanced design and analysis techniques such as dynamic programming and amortized analysis; graph algorithms such as minimum spanning trees and network ?os; NP-completeness theory; and approximation algorithms. What makes a programming language like “Python” or like “Java?” This course will look past superficial properties (like indentation) and into the soul of programming languages. We will explore a variety of topics in programming language construction and design: syntax and semantics, mechanisms for parameter passing, typing, scoping, and control structures. Students will expand their programming experience to include other programming paradigms, including functional languages like Scheme and ML. How does Google always understand what it is you’re looking for? How does Amazon.com figure out what items you might be interested in buying? How can categories of similar politicians be identified, based on their voting patterns? These questions can be answered via data mining, a field of study at the crossroads of artificial intelligence, database systems, and statistics. Data mining concerns itself with the goal of getting a computer to learn or discover patterns, especially those found within large datasets. We’ll focus on techniques such as classification, clustering, association rules, web mining, collaborative filtering, and others. This course focuses on investigating, understanding, and implementing the process of founding a start-up firm. Elements of searching out new venture opportunities, matching skills with a new venture, financing, competitive strategy, intellectual property, and operating a new venture will be explored. The focus of the course will be the development and presentation of a business plan created by teams of students with various academic backgrounds. This course is designed to help students develop their knowledge, confidence, skills, and self-image necessary to pursue entrepreneurial ventures in such domains as business, government, and public service. It provides a foundation in the fundamentals of entrepreneurial leadership, as well as a source of inspiration and energy in the art and science of taking visions and bringing them to reality. Entrepreneurship is innovation in practice: transforming ideas into opportunities, and, through a deliberate process, opportunities into commercial realities. These entrepreneurial activities can take place in two contexts: the creation of new organizations; and within existing organizations. This course will present an entrepreneurial framework for these entrepreneurial processes, supported by case studies that illustrate essential elements. Successful entrepreneurs and expert practitioners will be introduced who will highlight practical approaches to entrepreneurial success. This course focuses on institutional and product marketing methods used by start-up to medium-sized companies. After an overview of basic marketing principles, the course will cover the spectrum from day-to-day marketing activities of the entrepreneurial business to positioning and strategy. Students will learn to analyze, formulate, and implement marketing strategy, and learn the fundamentals of market research, pricing, and reaching and selling to customers. This course focuses on understanding how to construct the data and find appropriate financing for a start-up venture. Various forms of financing are introduced: vendor financing, factoring, etc. Through a medley of tests, case studies, and team exercises, students exercise basic financial skills such as financial statement formulation, NPV analysis and scenario analysis. This course focuses on the key components of starting a venture-scalable high-tech business. The course will examine the full life cycle of a startup; from opportunity assessment and market sizing to R&D and operation plans and go-to-market and distribution strategy. The course will also cover venture capital, legal considerations and team building. The role of angel investors, venture capitalists, and non-dilutive funding will be covered in depth. Student teams will write and present a business plan to active venture capitalists.

The wide applicability of these ideas and their deep connection with the natural sciences have made this discipline one of the most fruitful arenas of human inquiry. Combining, as it does, the greatest creative freedom with the most stringent standards of rigor, Mathematics also happens to be the ideal training ground for learning a broad range of analytical and problem-solving skills. Ashoka University’s Mathematics major program has been designed to meet two primary goals: Students should get a broad exposure to the primary areas and the central ideas of contemporary Mathematics (as well as their applications) and Students should develop rigorous, analytical reasoning skills, along with problem-solving ability. In addition to the Foundation courses that are common across disciplines, students aiming to choose Mathematics as their major should take the enabling course on Calculus as early as possible. This will be followed by 11 required and 3 elective courses in Mathematics. The required courses cover the areas of Analysis, Algebra, Linear Algebra, Probability, and Differential Equations. Elective courses vary from semester to semester depending on student and faculty interests. In addition, students have the opportunity to study some special topics in depth under the guidance of a faculty member. At the end of the program of study, we expect students to be able to read and understand mathematical proofs; learn and apply new mathematical concepts; and, construct and communicate a correct and rigorous argument on their own. Most importantly, we expect students to be able to solve new mathematical problems on their own. Students completing this program will be well prepared to pursue Mathematics further or to take up positions that call for innovative problem solving in concert with strong analytical abilities. Students may also opt for an inter-disciplinary BSc (Hons.) with Major in Mathematics and Computer Science. This allows them to get a wider variety of problem-solving skills as well as make them more attractive to the industry.\\xa0 Undergraduate programmes can be followed by a one-year Ashoka Scholars Program (ASP) in mathematics. In addition, students of other disciplines can deepen their mathematics background by getting a Minor in Mathematics or a Concentration in Mathematics.\\xa0    Each student will take a total of 15 mathematics courses. For completing a major in Mathematics, one must take the following courses (12 required courses and 3 elective courses).

The most important thing I learned from my time at Ashoka is how to think creatively about mathematics. The CTS Intro to Proofs class, in particular, taught me that math is more than just a collection of theorems and proofs; good mathematics tells a story! Ashoka taught me how to effectively communicate mathematics. Narmada Varadarajan (Founding Batch), Ph.D. student, University of Toronto  I was given enough room and support to make mistakes and slowly build up from ground zero in all of my math courses. My professors’ investment in me made life at Ashoka more warm – whether it was spending ridiculous amounts of time during office hours on a concept I could not wrap my head around, giving me advice on life problems, welcoming my ideas for the department, showing up for my performances, or not letting me take the easy way out when I really wanted to. Math is a difficult subject, and I would not have been able to survive it without my brilliant and warm peers and juniors, and our endless coffee-fueled solving sessions. Saloni Mehta (UG’20) Business Analyst, Arthur D. Little India  The Ashoka math undergraduate program provides excellent preparation for students interested in pursuing a career in mathematical research. At Ashoka, I was exposed to a variety of courses from many different areas of mathematics. Each course was taught by an expert in the area that the course pertained to. As a consequence, I found that I was taught mathematics at the proper level of rigour, depth, and clarity. The option to complete a capstone thesis in mathematics allowed me to get exposed to various facets of modern mathematical research, which helped me decide to pursue a career in research. Siddharth Mulherkar (UG’20) – PhD Student, University of California, Los Angeles (UCLA)  The math department offers an incredible range of possibilities for the study of mathematics (including colloquiums, advanced electives and ISMs). It seriously cares about cultivating the research interests of its students, which is rare at the undergraduate level in India. Ojas Kumar (UG’22)  I am in a process of learning the essence of math from the point where I missed out on things. Ashoka is providing me the ambiance for rigorous learning. Enjoying the process well. Anulya P. (UG’22)  The Mathematics Department at Ashoka University, in my experience offers one of the most advanced undergraduate curriculums amongst the few other Indian institutions like the IITs, ISI, CMI etc. The courses offered range from basic to some of the advanced ones which are usually hard to find in other Indian undergraduate programs. The courses cover the appropriate standard material every undergraduate math major is expected to know. One of the distinguishing features of our program is that it offers a better flexibility in adjusting the courses to our convenience by allowing us to take certain courses later in the undergraduate years or even retaking some courses for a better understanding or even improving the grades. Moreover, the learning and research conducive concepts of Independent Study Modules (Reading Courses) and a Capstone Thesis under a particular faculty mentor, are one of the most unique features of the mathematics undergraduate program at Ashoka in the Indian context. The Mathematics undergraduate program at Ashoka also prepares us well for pursuing graduate studies in Mathematics or related fields abroad or in India. Manas Srivastava (UG’20) – ASP’22  The Math department at Ashoka is like a family. The small batch sizes and excellent student-faculty ratio means that the students and faculty get to know each other well. The professors are extremely approachable for mentorship, guidance, and also provide us with the opportunity to pursue guided research projects in fields of our interest. The mathematical training that studying Math at Ashoka enables us to become better problem solvers, researchers, and employees. Aayush Soni (UG’21), ASP’22 batch  Math was something I have always been unsure about– too many other things interested me. But I think that’s what’s great about math at Ashoka. You get to do things outside of math. If you’re ever stuck on a problem for too long, you can always go build a clay sculpture or hear your roommate rant about the fundamental flaws of democracy and think to yourself, “maybe solving this differential equation might just be an easier task than fixing years of social inequalities that have stemmed from capitalism.” And maybe, if you’re smart enough, you might just figure out a way to solve both.

The students majoring in Chemistry as well as those who are interested or doing minor, both will get benefit from this course. Meticulous understanding of chemistry for any students is the focus of th is syllabus.  Chemistry is involved in everything we do. Even if y ou are not chemist, every time you cook, bake, use the washing powder, toothpaste or taking medicine, you are dealing with chemicals . The study of Chemist ry provides a molecular level of description as well as insights into chemical bonding and give you a perfect picture of bond breaking and forming, overall a reaction. At Ashoka, our objective is to teach Chemistry in an integrative and holistic manner connecting with other branches of science, physics, biology, computer and environmental science . We are constantly trying to correlate with them and bring out the best int erest of our students. We are very hopeful to be an integrated part of Ashoka University in near future.  Further, the chemistry department is building up to do innovative and current research. This semester we have no lab course officially, but students interested to do any chemical reaction studying in theory class are always welcome and perform under the monitoring of professor s. The chemistry research requires to have a very sound knowledge on the basic of chemistry and our target is to build you up as an aspiring researcher through the basic concept of organic, inorganic and physical chemistry in this semester. We are very certain that this knowledge will take you further for any field of science or humanities.   The undergraduate Major in C hemistry  The chemistry major in Ashoka University designed with a belief that the students getting a degree in chemistry can take him/her wherever he/she want s to go, whether it is industry or immediate professional career, or further research in chemistry or intermediate subjects. The chemistry major must complete a total 14 courses to get a graduate degree from Ashoka University. This includes 7 core theory courses and 4 lab courses and any 3 electives. Courses offered by chemistry department or cross -listed with the chemistry department (if any) will also be counted. T he final year students will be offered proposal writing course and can pursue independent research in the department.  The core (theory) courses are:  • Energetics of Change (Semester II) • Basic Inorganic Chemistry (Semester III)  • Concepts in Organic Chemistry (Semester III)  • Atoms, quanta and light (Semester III)  • Inorganic Chemistry (Semester IV)  • Rate, order and mechanism (Semester IV)  • Mechanistic Organic Chemistry (Semester V) • Modern Methods of Analysis and Characterization (Semester V) • Organic Synthesis: Reagents and Synthetic Strategies (Semester VI)  Electives  Electives courses are there to broaden the knowledge of the core courses so that students c an have better understanding of the subjects.

FAQs      20         2 Introduction Physics is a doorway to some of the most beautiful and profound phenomena in the universe like black holes, supernovae, Bose -Einstein condensates, superconductors. It is, simultaneously, a driver of lifestyle -changing technology, e.g., engines, electricity, and transistors; and a powerful way of perceiving and analyzing problems that can be applied in various domains, both within and outside standard physics. The beauty and profundity of the phenomena studied by physicists offer romance and excite passion, and the utility of its discoveries and th e power of its methods arouse interest.  These methods can be very intricate and demanding: theoretical physics requires a skilful combination of physical and mathematical thinking, and experimental physics requires in addition the ability to turn tentati ve ideas into physical devices that can put those ideas to the test. As a result, the successful practice of physics demands rigour, flexibility, mechanical adroitness, persistence, and great imagination. The physicist’s imagination is nourished not just b y physics but also by other areas of human enquiry and thought, of the kind that an Ashoka undergraduate is expected to encounter.  With all of this in mind, the physics programme has been designed to: (i) allow students wishing to major in physics to discov er real physics and make a wise choice, in the first year; (ii) provide, throughout, a thorough training in fundamental physics; (iii) bring together everything learnt earlier, and give students the option to pursue more advanced courses in physics or branch out into other areas, in the third year. The idea is to accompany those wishing to become professional physicists as they take the f irst steps in that direction, and to introduce everyone who goes through the programme to the physicist’s way of thinking.     3 Physics Major – Typical Trajectory Semester 2: Discovering UG -level Physics A student wishing to major, minor, or pursue a concentration in Physics is expected to take the introductory course in calculus (Calculus I) offered by the Mathematics Department. Students wishing to major in Physics should plan to take it in their first s emester.  Requirement for Physics major : 13 core physics courses + 2 electives (60 credits)  The physics -major sequence begins in semester 2, with two courses, one in theoretical physics and the other in experimental physics. The first purpose of these c ourses is to provide an experience of UG level physics on the basis of which a student can decide whether or not to major in physics, i.e., they are gateway courses. The second purpose of these courses is to serve as an introduction to the physicist’s way of thinking about problems and solving them, something that has proved useful not just to physicists but also to those in other disciplines that make use of quantitative methods and experiments, e.g., mathematics, computer science, economics, psychology, a nd biology.  Semester 3, 4 and 5: The Physics Core  The physics courses in these 3 semesters form the core of the physicist’s undergraduate canon. Anyone majoring in physics is expected to be thorough in these areas. Each semester has 2 -3 theory courses and an accompanying lab.  Semester 6: Exploring more advanced options  The student can opt for elective courses: each student majoring in physics is required to take at least two. From the student’s point of view, the electives chosen is likely to indicate a post -graduate direction – towards theoretical physics, towards experimental physics or perhaps away from physics into an allied discipline that would benefit from training in physics.        4 Physics Minor or Concentration  To Minor in physics a student must do six courses in physics (24 credits). Of these the two gateway courses – MP1 and Lab 1 – are compulsory. At least two more courses should be taken from among the core courses offered in semesters 3, 4, and 5, provided a ppropriate prerequisites have been satisfied for these courses (recommended courses: Classical Mechanics and Thermal Physics).  The remaining two may be either other compulsory or elective courses offered by the Physics Department or cross -listed with Phy sics, provided appropriate prerequisites have been satisfied. In place of one elective course, a student may take an Independent Study Module (ISM) of equivalent credit.  For a Concentration in physics a student must do six courses in physics (16 credits ). Of these the two gateway courses – MP1 and Lab 1 – are compulsory.  At least two more courses should be taken from among the core courses offered in semesters 3, 4, and 5, provided appropriate prerequisites have been satisfied for these courses (recomm ended courses: Classical Mechanics and Thermal Physics)          5 General Information on the Physics Courses Mathematical level — All theory courses are calculus -based. The level of mathematical sophistication will increase progressively. The mathematical - physics courses will be application -oriented rather than proof -oriented. Familiarity with +2 level physics and mathematics is a ssumed.  Labs — All lab courses will involve extensive use of instruments to make observations. These experiments will in general illustrate ideas studied in the accompanying theory courses.  The use of computers — Many theory courses will include computa tional exercises, generally using the programming language Python. Labs will also require the use of computers.  Duration — Theory courses: two lectures a week each lasting 1.5 hours. In addition, there may be a 1.5 -hour tutorial per week . Laboratory: one 3 -hour main lab session per week and one 3 -hour extra session per week for lab course.  List of Physics Courses Compulsory/Core Courses Mathematical Physics 1 (Gateway course: semester 2) This course aims to familiarise the student with a variety of mathematical techniques which every student of physics should be conversant with. Having taken the course, you should be comfortable with casting a wide variety of physics problems in mathematical language and being able to analyse and solve them subsequently.

The goal of this introductory lab is to help students develop the skills needed for experimental physics. Students will be introduced to the basic concepts of data collection, analysis, and interpretation over the span of the course by working on different experimental problems which have been carefully selected to represent different branches of physics.  Pre-requis ites: none.  Classical Mechanics (semester 3) Newtonian mechanics and an introduction to Lagrangian and Hamiltonian mechanics. Newtonian mechanics is, both historically and otherwise, the starting point of all of physics. The Lagrangian and Hamiltonian formulations of classical mechanics allow a more profound vision of the subject while also introducing the language in which much of higher -level theoretical physics is expressed.  Pre-requisites: MP1  Electricity & Magnetism in Light of Relativity (semester 3 ) The beautiful theory of electricity and magnetism is, with classical mechanics, the heart of c lassical physics. What is often not appreciated at the undergraduate level is that electricity and magnetism are related in a way that reveals the structure of space -time. In this course relativity will be used from the beginning to relate electric and mag netic fields, so that their unity, as components of the electromagnetic field are revealed and used in the study of Maxwell’s Equations.  Pre-requisites: MP1  Physics Lab 2 (semester 3) Designed to accompany the theory courses Classical Mechanics and Ele ctricity & Magnetism in Light of Relativity, this laboratory course explores their experimental foundations. Students will be introduced to video -analysis and modelling to study elastic and inelastic collisions, uniformly accelerated motion, and terminal v elocity.

In addition, mechanical systems which exhibit oscillatory behaviour, like coupled pendula and capillary waves, will also be studied. Students will also be introduced to ideas of thermometry and calibration.  Pre-requisi tes: Physics Lab I.        8 Quantum Mechanics (semester 5) This course is an introduction to Quantum Mechanics (QM). Starting with a historical introduction and motivation, it goes on to introduce probability amplitudes as the fundamental physical basis for QM. Using the Dirac bra -ket notation, the fundamental postulates are then introduced and their consequences worked out. The basic physical concepts are illustrated through spin -½ systems and one -dimensional wave mechanics. Symmetries and Conservation laws in QM are discussed, an introduction to the basic theory of angular momentum and spin is given, and the course culminates with the first major triumph of QM - a quantum mechanical understanding of the hydrogen atom.  Pre-requisites: Classical Mechanics, M athematical Physics I and II.  Strongly recommended: Linear Algebra (Department of Mathematics).  Statistical Mechanics (semester 5) Statistical mechanics allows one to solve problems involving large numbers of particles by exploiting statistical regularities.

This course is an introduction to the essential concepts of the subject.  Pre-requisites: Thermal Physics.  Physics Lab 4 (semester 5) Designed to accompany the two theory courses Quantum Mechanics and Statistical Mechanics; this laboratory course explor es their experimental foundations. Students will be introduced to some of the experiments which require Quantum Mechanics in order to be explained, notably discrete atomic spectra and the Zeeman Effect. The lab will also contain experiments on Brownian Mot ion and the determination of other properties of matter like magnetic susceptibility.  Pre-requisites: Physics Lab I.  The Physics of Matter (semester 6 ) In real physical systems the various areas of fundamental physics that are studied separately in pre vious semesters are usually required all at once. The purpose of this course is to show how fundamental physics can be used to study a number of interesting phenomena.  Pre-requisites: All mandatory courses in the physics -major sequence.     9 Elective Physics Courses  Elective courses (for the 3rd and 4th year) are listed below.

Alternatively, students wishing to broaden their education further can use it to take a minor/concentration in any other subject or simply take whatev er courses in any department they wish to.  Advanced Major The advanced major is for students intending to pursue higher studies and research in physics. It would enable them to take some advanced physics courses as well as get an idea of research through the capstone project/thesis.  Requirements: 7th Semester: Required to take 16 credits of which the capstone project comprises 8 credits. The students can opt for 1 or 2 courses comprising 4 credits/course.  8th Semester: Required to take 16 credits of which the capstone project comprises 8 credits. The students can opt for 1 or 2 courses comprising 4 credits/course.  Over the whole year (2 semesters), some courses apart from Thesis may also be taken from outside the physics department .     11 Capstone Project and Thesis:  Interested students should talk, in their 6th semester, to prospective advisors about possible projects. After mutual agreement - the advisor agrees to guide the student and the student agrees to work on one of the projects suggested by the advisor - stude nts should start with necessary background reading / preliminary work over the summer before the start of the fourth year.  At the end of the 7th semester the project would be assessed with a presentation and report - this will be evaluated by the physics faculty. Students without satisfactory progress at this stage may not continue for the thesis subsequently.  At the end of the 8th semester the thesis has to be submitted and defended before a panel which may also include some external members. It is mandatory to successfully complete the capstone project and thesis to be eligible for the advanced major.  Other options (Minor/Concentration)  Students not opting for the advanced major can take courses as per their interest in the fourth year. It is reco mmended that physics majors take two physics electives over the year. Those minoring in physics (or taking it as a concentration) may take physics courses accordingly to meet the necessary requirements.               12 TF/TA -ship Policy ❖ The Teaching Fellows are recruited after a departmental screening process.  ❖ Fourth year (ASP) physics students can be TAs for some of the introductory physics courses. This depends on the departmental requirement and the position may be offered either for credits or may be a paid position.  ❖ MLS students are assigned to be TAs as a part of their academic requirements.  Independent Study Module (ISM) ❖ Students may opt for an ISM if interested and if a faculty member is available for this purpose.  ❖ A successfully completed ISM would contribute 2 to 4 credits to the student’s GPA.  ❖ Students who wish to take up an ISM should contact the Professor under whose guidance they wish to work to discuss details.       13 Faculty  Somendra M.

Laboratory: one 3 -hour main lab session per week and one 3 -hour extra session per week for lab course.  List of Physics Courses Compulsory/Core Courses Mathematical Physics 1 (Gateway course: semester 2) This course aims to familiarise the student with a variety of mathematical techniques which every student of physics should be conversant with. Having taken the course, you should be comfortable with casting a wide variety of physics problems in mathematical language and being able to analyse and solve them subsequently. The course will also include an introduction to programming with Python. Within the physics curriculu m at Ashoka university, this course is an essential prerequisite for Classical Mechanics and Electricity and Magnetism in Light of Relativity offered in the third semester.  Pre-requisites: Students who have not done mathematics at the 12th -grade level are required to take Calculus I.     6 Physics Lab 1 (Gateway course: semester 2) An introduction to physics through experiments. The goal of this introductory lab is to help students develop the skills needed for experimental physics. Students will be introduced to the basic concepts of data collection, analysis, and interpretation over the span of the course by working on different experimental problems which have been carefully selected to represent different branches of physics.  Pre-requis ites: none.  Classical Mechanics (semester 3) Newtonian mechanics and an introduction to Lagrangian and Hamiltonian mechanics. Newtonian mechanics is, both historically and otherwise, the starting point of all of physics. The Lagrangian and Hamiltonian formulations of classical mechanics allow a more profound vision of the subject while also introducing the language in which much of higher -level theoretical physics is expressed.  Pre-requisites: MP1  Electricity & Magnetism in Light of Relativity (semester 3 ) The beautiful theory of electricity and magnetism is, with classical mechanics, the heart of c lassical physics. What is often not appreciated at the undergraduate level is that electricity and magnetism are related in a way that reveals the structure of space -time. In this course relativity will be used from the beginning to relate electric and mag netic fields, so that their unity, as components of the electromagnetic field are revealed and used in the study of Maxwell’s Equations.  Pre-requisites: MP1  Physics Lab 2 (semester 3) Designed to accompany the theory courses Classical Mechanics and Ele ctricity & Magnetism in Light of Relativity, this laboratory course explores their experimental foundations. Students will be introduced to video -analysis and modelling to study elastic and inelastic collisions, uniformly accelerated motion, and terminal v elocity. In addition, students will also be introduced to physical systems exhibiting electromagnetic damping, resonant electronics circuits, and two -dimensional electrostatics.  Pre-requisites: Physics Lab 1      7 Mathematical Physics 2 (semester 4 ) This mathematical physics course aims to be an introduction to differential equations. Besides standard topics in ordinary and partial differential equations, nonlinear dynamical systems will be studied and nonlinear ODEs will be analysed using geometric a nd computational tools. Fourier series will also be studied.  Pre-requisites: MP1  Thermal Physics (semester 4) An Integrated Approach to Thermodynamics and Kinetic Theory. There are three approaches to study systems with large numbers of atoms and molec ules, which exhibit properties like temperature and entropy: kinetic theory, classical thermodynamics, and statistical mechanics. In this course, these three approaches will be taught in an integrated fashion.  Pre-requisites: Mathematical Physics 1.  Oscillations, Waves, and Optics (semester 4) Oscillatory phenomena appear in all areas of physics, both classical and quantum (to the point where a famous textbook begins by saying that the domain of physics is all phenomena that can be reduced to coupled oscillators). The methods used to study oscillatory motion are powerful and wide -ranging in their utility.  Pre-requisites: MP1, Classical Mechanics and Electricity & Magnetism.  Physics Lab 3 (semester 4) Designed to accompany the theory courses Therma l Physics and Oscillations, Waves & Optics, this laboratory course explores their experimental foundations. Students will be introduced to the properties of light as a wave: interference, diffraction, and polarisation, through conceptually rich experiments like the Michelson Interferometer. In addition, mechanical systems which exhibit oscillatory behaviour, like coupled pendula and capillary waves, will also be studied. Students will also be introduced to ideas of thermometry and calibration.  Pre-requisi tes: Physics Lab I.        8 Quantum Mechanics (semester 5) This course is an introduction to Quantum Mechanics (QM). Starting with a historical introduction and motivation, it goes on to introduce probability amplitudes as the fundamental physical basis for QM. Using the Dirac bra -ket notation, the fundamental postulates are then introduced and their consequences worked out. The basic physical concepts are illustrated through spin -½ systems and one -dimensional wave mechanics. Symmetries and Conservation laws in QM are discussed, an introduction to the basic theory of angular momentum and spin is given, and the course culminates with the first major triumph of QM - a quantum mechanical understanding of the hydrogen atom.  Pre-requisites: Classical Mechanics, M athematical Physics I and II.  Strongly recommended: Linear Algebra (Department of Mathematics).  Statistical Mechanics (semester 5) Statistical mechanics allows one to solve problems involving large numbers of particles by exploiting statistical regularities. When combined with quantum mechanics, it helps physicists to understand some of the most fascinating phenomena in the universe. This course is an introduction to the essential concepts of the subject.  Pre-requisites: Thermal Physics.  Physics Lab 4 (semester 5) Designed to accompany the two theory courses Quantum Mechanics and Statistical Mechanics; this laboratory course explor es their experimental foundations. Students will be introduced to some of the experiments which require Quantum Mechanics in order to be explained, notably discrete atomic spectra and the Zeeman Effect. The lab will also contain experiments on Brownian Mot ion and the determination of other properties of matter like magnetic susceptibility.  Pre-requisites: Physics Lab I.  The Physics of Matter (semester 6 ) In real physical systems the various areas of fundamental physics that are studied separately in pre vious semesters are usually required all at once. The purpose of this course is to show how fundamental physics can be used to study a number of interesting phenomena.  Pre-requisites: All mandatory courses in the physics -major sequence.     9 Elective Physics Courses  Elective courses (for the 3rd and 4th year) are listed below.

Alternatively, students wishing to broaden their education further can use it to take a minor/concentration in any other subject or simply take whatev er courses in any department they wish to.  Advanced Major The advanced major is for students intending to pursue higher studies and research in physics. It would enable them to take some advanced physics courses as well as get an idea of research through the capstone project/thesis.  Requirements: 7th Semester: Required to take 16 credits of which the capstone project comprises 8 credits. The students can opt for 1 or 2 courses comprising 4 credits/course.  8th Semester: Required to take 16 credits of which the capstone project comprises 8 credits. The students can opt for 1 or 2 courses comprising 4 credits/course.  Over the whole year (2 semesters), some courses apart from Thesis may also be taken from outside the physics department .     11 Capstone Project and Thesis:  Interested students should talk, in their 6th semester, to prospective advisors about possible projects. After mutual agreement - the advisor agrees to guide the student and the student agrees to work on one of the projects suggested by the advisor - stude nts should start with necessary background reading / preliminary work over the summer before the start of the fourth year.  At the end of the 7th semester the project would be assessed with a presentation and report - this will be evaluated by the physics faculty. Students without satisfactory progress at this stage may not continue for the thesis subsequently.  At the end of the 8th semester the thesis has to be submitted and defended before a panel which may also include some external members. It is mandatory to successfully complete the capstone project and thesis to be eligible for the advanced major.  Other options (Minor/Concentration)  Students not opting for the advanced major can take courses as per their interest in the fourth year. It is reco mmended that physics majors take two physics electives over the year. Those minoring in physics (or taking it as a concentration) may take physics courses accordingly to meet the necessary requirements.               12 TF/TA -ship Policy ❖ The Teaching Fellows are recruited after a departmental screening process.  ❖ Fourth year (ASP) physics students can be TAs for some of the introductory physics courses. This depends on the departmental requirement and the position may be offered either for credits or may be a paid position.  ❖ MLS students are assigned to be TAs as a part of their academic requirements.  Independent Study Module (ISM) ❖ Students may opt for an ISM if interested and if a faculty member is available for this purpose.  ❖ A successfully completed ISM would contribute 2 to 4 credits to the student’s GPA.  ❖ Students who wish to take up an ISM should contact the Professor under whose guidance they wish to work to discuss details.       13 Faculty  Somendra M.

What are going to be the mandatory courses to pursue a minor in Physics? Answer: The gateway courses (Mathematical and Computational Toolkit and Laboratory 1) are the mandatory courses to pursue a physics minor. Apart from these two, the student is expected to take 4 courses of their choice. Of these 4 courses at least two should be taken from among the other core courses. The remaining two can be core or elective courses and one of them can also be an ISM. So, in total a student has to do 6 courses to complete a minor in Physics.  2. What are the mandatory courses for a concentration in Physics? Answer: The gateway courses (Mathematical and Computational Toolkit and Laboratory 1) are the mandatory courses to pursue a physics concentration. Apart from these two, the student is expected to take 2 courses of their choice from among the core courses. So, in total a student has to do 4 courses to complete a concentration in Physics.  3. What are the man datory courses for the Ashoka Scholar Programme (ASP) students? Answer: A project (Capstone project) and the Capstone thesis are mandatory for an Advanced Major in Physics.      21 4. Will the mandatory courses be offered every semester? Answer: The mandatory gateway courses are offered in the spring semesters. Other core courses are spread throughout the 6 semesters. All courses are not offered in every semester.  5. What are the prerequisites to major in Physics? Answer: The student is expected to have a sci ence/mathematics background in their high school (at +2 level).

A historian combines the skills of a detective, a \\xa0 \\xa0 \\xa0 \\xa0 \\xa0 \\xa0 \\xa0 \\xa0 \\xa0 \\xa0 \\xa0 \\xa0 \\xa0 \\xa0 \\xa0 \\xa0 \\xa0 \\xa0 scavenger, a judge and a ventriloquist. S/he is an artist and a skilled craftsperson who spins and \\xa0 \\xa0 \\xa0 \\xa0 \\xa0 \\xa0 \\xa0 \\xa0 \\xa0 \\xa0 \\xa0 \\xa0 \\xa0 \\xa0 \\xa0 \\xa0 \\xa0 weaves narratives of the past. Historical creativity lies in gathering, wrestling with, and \\xa0 \\xa0 \\xa0 \\xa0 \\xa0 \\xa0 \\xa0 \\xa0 \\xa0 \\xa0 \\xa0 \\xa0 \\xa0 connecting the traces of the past to construct a rich tapestry of human lives, emotions, and \\xa0 \\xa0 \\xa0 \\xa0 \\xa0 \\xa0 \\xa0 \\xa0 \\xa0 \\xa0 \\xa0 \\xa0 \\xa0 \\xa0 \\xa0 \\xa0 ideas. These traces come in various garbs – gravestones, burial sites, forgotten cities, mud \\xa0 \\xa0 \\xa0 \\xa0 \\xa0 \\xa0 \\xa0 \\xa0 \\xa0 \\xa0 \\xa0 \\xa0 \\xa0 \\xa0 pots, musical notes, folklores, war songs, memoirs, archival records, speeches, letters, \\xa0 \\xa0 \\xa0 \\xa0 \\xa0 \\xa0 \\xa0 \\xa0 \\xa0 \\xa0 \\xa0 newspapers, cartoons, cave art, paintings, architecture, clothes, food, chronicles, cinema, \\xa0 \\xa0 \\xa0 \\xa0 \\xa0 \\xa0 \\xa0 \\xa0 \\xa0 \\xa0 advertisements – all and any remnant of human existence. \\xa0 A historian’s ability to make effective use of these materials requires inculcation of two \\xa0 \\xa0 \\xa0 \\xa0 \\xa0 \\xa0 \\xa0 \\xa0 \\xa0 \\xa0 \\xa0 \\xa0 \\xa0 \\xa0 core ideas: empathy and imagination. Empathy fuels and glues our connection with other \\xa0 \\xa0 \\xa0 \\xa0 \\xa0 \\xa0 \\xa0 \\xa0 \\xa0 \\xa0 \\xa0 \\xa0 \\xa0 humans. It helps us recognize others’ perceptions, feelings and ways of being. Empathy is a \\xa0 \\xa0 \\xa0 \\xa0 \\xa0 \\xa0 \\xa0 \\xa0 \\xa0 \\xa0 \\xa0 \\xa0 \\xa0 \\xa0 \\xa0 vital tool of a historian because it obligates a historian to question and challenge a single \\xa0 \\xa0 \\xa0 \\xa0 \\xa0 \\xa0 \\xa0 \\xa0 \\xa0 \\xa0 \\xa0 \\xa0 \\xa0 \\xa0 \\xa0 \\xa0 conception of the world in order to access other worlds and other lives. Thus the spirit of \\xa0 \\xa0 \\xa0 \\xa0 \\xa0 \\xa0 \\xa0 \\xa0 \\xa0 \\xa0 \\xa0 \\xa0 \\xa0 \\xa0 \\xa0 \\xa0 \\xa0 questioning and the consciousness of one’s own frames of reference is the starting point of \\xa0 \\xa0 \\xa0 \\xa0 \\xa0 \\xa0 \\xa0 \\xa0 \\xa0 \\xa0 \\xa0 \\xa0 \\xa0 \\xa0 \\xa0 historical inquiry. The second feature of imagination is the creative faculty which enables us to \\xa0 \\xa0 \\xa0 \\xa0 \\xa0 \\xa0 \\xa0 \\xa0 \\xa0 \\xa0 \\xa0 \\xa0 \\xa0 \\xa0 \\xa0 form images and feelings that ordinary senses cannot perceive. It is a critical instrument for a \\xa0 \\xa0 \\xa0 \\xa0 \\xa0 \\xa0 \\xa0 \\xa0 \\xa0 \\xa0 \\xa0 \\xa0 \\xa0 \\xa0 \\xa0 \\xa0 historian who studies worlds that are removed both in time and space from his or her own. \\xa0 \\xa0 \\xa0 \\xa0 \\xa0 \\xa0 \\xa0 \\xa0 \\xa0 \\xa0 \\xa0 \\xa0 \\xa0 \\xa0 \\xa0 \\xa0 \\xa0 Conjuring up those historical worlds requires a leap of imagination, a willing suspension of \\xa0 \\xa0 \\xa0 \\xa0 \\xa0 \\xa0 \\xa0 \\xa0 \\xa0 \\xa0 \\xa0 \\xa0 \\xa0 \\xa0 disbelief and a readiness to encounter the unknown. \\xa0 \\xa0 \\xa0 HISTORY MAJOR, MINOR, & CONCENTRATION \\xa0 \\xa0 The Department of History requires students to take a total of \\u200b 12 courses in three years in order \\xa0 \\xa0 \\xa0 \\xa0 \\xa0 \\xa0 \\xa0 \\xa0 \\xa0 \\xa0 \\xa0 \\xa0 \\xa0 \\xa0 \\xa0 \\xa0 \\xa0 \\xa0 to receive the History Major degree and \\u200b 10 to receive the History-IR Major degree, according to \\xa0 \\xa0 \\xa0 \\xa0 \\xa0 \\xa0 \\xa0 \\xa0 \\xa0 \\xa0 \\xa0 \\xa0 \\xa0 \\xa0 \\xa0 \\xa0 UGC guidelines. However, the course should be considered as a four year programme, \\xa0 \\xa0 \\xa0 \\xa0 \\xa0 \\xa0 \\xa0 \\xa0 \\xa0 \\xa0 \\xa0 \\xa0 \\xa0 including the ‘Advanced Major’, which brings the total courses to 16 in four years for History \\xa0 \\xa0 \\xa0 \\xa0 \\xa0 \\xa0 \\xa0 \\xa0 \\xa0 \\xa0 \\xa0 \\xa0 \\xa0 \\xa0 \\xa0 \\xa0 Majors and 14 for History-IR Majors. \\xa0 \\xa0 History students have to do a mix of compulsory and elective courses. Compulsory \\xa0 \\xa0 \\xa0 \\xa0 \\xa0 \\xa0 \\xa0 \\xa0 \\xa0 \\xa0 \\xa0 \\xa0 \\xa0 courses provide students with a basic grounding in the discipline. Elective courses seek to stir, \\xa0 \\xa0 \\xa0 \\xa0 \\xa0 \\xa0 \\xa0 \\xa0 \\xa0 \\xa0 \\xa0 \\xa0 \\xa0 \\xa0 \\xa0 whet, and capture a student’s historical imagination through a conceptual, historiographical \\xa0 \\xa0 \\xa0 \\xa0 \\xa0 \\xa0 \\xa0 \\xa0 \\xa0 \\xa0 \\xa0 and methodological study of different historical themes and subjects. In addition, the UG \\xa0 \\xa0 \\xa0 \\xa0 \\xa0 \\xa0 \\xa0 \\xa0 \\xa0 \\xa0 \\xa0 \\xa0 \\xa0 Research Thesis/Project (for third-year students) and the Capstone Thesis (for ASP students) \\xa0 \\xa0 \\xa0 \\xa0 \\xa0 \\xa0 \\xa0 \\xa0 \\xa0 \\xa0 \\xa0 \\xa0 offer History students opportunities to put into practice their understanding of the discipline of \\xa0 \\xa0 \\xa0 \\xa0 \\xa0 \\xa0 \\xa0 \\xa0 \\xa0 \\xa0 \\xa0 \\xa0 \\xa0 \\xa0 history by undertaking independent inquiry on their chosen historical themes. \\xa0 \\xa0 2 \\xa0History Curriculum \\xa0 \\xa0 \\xa0 History Core Courses: \\xa0 A.\\u200b \\u200b GATEWAY COURSES: \\xa0 ● HIS-1001 European History from Renaissance to Revolution (Spring) \\xa0 ● HIS-2001 History of India I: From Prehistoric Beginnings to the Mauryan Empire \\xa0 (Spring) \\xa0 ● HIS-2002 History of India II: From the Mauryan Empire to c. 1000 CE \\xa0 (Monsoon) \\xa0 ● HIS-2003 History of India III: From c. 1000 CE to 1764 CE (Spring) \\xa0 ● HIS-2004 History of India IV: From 1764 CE to 1967 CE (Spring) \\xa0 \\xa0 B.

The TPA is responsible for assisting the faculty with setting up the classroom and \\xa0 \\xa0 \\xa0 \\xa0 \\xa0 \\xa0 \\xa0 \\xa0 \\xa0 \\xa0 \\xa0 \\xa0 \\xa0 \\xa0 \\xa0 holding office hours outside of the class meetings (2 hrs per week) to meet with the students to \\xa0 \\xa0 \\xa0 \\xa0 \\xa0 \\xa0 \\xa0 \\xa0 \\xa0 \\xa0 \\xa0 \\xa0 \\xa0 \\xa0 \\xa0 \\xa0 \\xa0 \\xa0 continue the discussion, help them with paper topics and writing, and other course-related \\xa0 \\xa0 \\xa0 \\xa0 \\xa0 \\xa0 \\xa0 \\xa0 \\xa0 \\xa0 \\xa0 \\xa0 \\xa0 questions. \\xa0 TPA’s will \\u200b not be responsible for grading or evaluating other students’ work, except \\xa0 \\xa0 \\xa0 \\xa0 \\xa0 \\xa0 \\xa0 \\xa0 \\xa0 \\xa0 \\xa0 \\xa0 \\xa0 occasionally may be involved in the grading process with the faculty in order to learn how \\xa0 \\xa0 \\xa0 \\xa0 \\xa0 \\xa0 \\xa0 \\xa0 \\xa0 \\xa0 \\xa0 \\xa0 \\xa0 \\xa0 \\xa0 \\xa0 grading is done. The Teaching Practicum is considered as an apprenticeship, in which the \\xa0 \\xa0 \\xa0 \\xa0 \\xa0 \\xa0 \\xa0 \\xa0 \\xa0 \\xa0 \\xa0 \\xa0 \\xa0 \\xa0 faculty member is responsible to mentor, teach, and train the TPA in pedagogical methods. \\xa0 \\xa0 \\xa0 \\xa0 \\xa0 \\xa0 \\xa0 \\xa0 \\xa0 \\xa0 \\xa0 \\xa0 \\xa0 \\xa0 11 \\xa0TPA’s will also be required to attend pedagogy workshops during the Orientation week. The TPA \\xa0 \\xa0 \\xa0 \\xa0 \\xa0 \\xa0 \\xa0 \\xa0 \\xa0 \\xa0 \\xa0 \\xa0 \\xa0 \\xa0 \\xa0 may be assigned readings over and above the syllabus readings for the rest of the course. The \\xa0 \\xa0 \\xa0 \\xa0 \\xa0 \\xa0 \\xa0 \\xa0 \\xa0 \\xa0 \\xa0 \\xa0 \\xa0 \\xa0 \\xa0 \\xa0 \\xa0 workload should not exceed 3 hrs outside of class time per week. \\xa0 Every Teaching Practicum carries 2 credits. Students who wish to register for a \\xa0 \\xa0 \\xa0 \\xa0 \\xa0 \\xa0 \\xa0 \\xa0 \\xa0 \\xa0 \\xa0 \\xa0 \\xa0 Teaching Practicum will need to apply to the ASP Coordinator of the Department of History \\xa0 \\xa0 \\xa0 \\xa0 \\xa0 \\xa0 \\xa0 \\xa0 \\xa0 \\xa0 \\xa0 \\xa0 \\xa0 \\xa0 \\xa0 (currently Dr Aparna Vaidik) by July for the Monsoon Semester and by December for the Spring \\xa0 \\xa0 \\xa0 \\xa0 \\xa0 \\xa0 \\xa0 \\xa0 \\xa0 \\xa0 \\xa0 \\xa0 \\xa0 \\xa0 \\xa0 \\xa0 Semester. The History Teaching Practicum is meant primarily for History and History-IR \\xa0 \\xa0 \\xa0 \\xa0 \\xa0 \\xa0 \\xa0 \\xa0 \\xa0 \\xa0 \\xa0 \\xa0 Major students who are pursuing the ASP in their fourth year. Other students, including \\xa0 \\xa0 \\xa0 \\xa0 \\xa0 \\xa0 \\xa0 \\xa0 \\xa0 \\xa0 \\xa0 \\xa0 \\xa0 \\xa0 third-year students, may apply for this. The selection of students as TPAs and their allocation to \\xa0 \\xa0 \\xa0 \\xa0 \\xa0 \\xa0 \\xa0 \\xa0 \\xa0 \\xa0 \\xa0 \\xa0 \\xa0 \\xa0 \\xa0 \\xa0 individual courses will be done by the History faculty, taking into account the quality of the \\xa0 \\xa0 \\xa0 \\xa0 \\xa0 \\xa0 \\xa0 \\xa0 \\xa0 \\xa0 \\xa0 \\xa0 \\xa0 \\xa0 \\xa0 \\xa0 applications and pedagogical requirements. The decision and choice of the concerned faculty \\xa0 \\xa0 \\xa0 \\xa0 \\xa0 \\xa0 \\xa0 \\xa0 \\xa0 \\xa0 \\xa0 \\xa0 member will be binding. \\xa0 \\xa0 For further details and guidance about the History ASP, interested students should contact the \\xa0 \\xa0 \\xa0 \\xa0 \\xa0 \\xa0 \\xa0 \\xa0 \\xa0 \\xa0 \\xa0 \\xa0 \\xa0 \\xa0 History ASP Coordinator Dr. Aparna Vaidik. \\xa0 \\xa0 \\xa0 Language Courses \\xa0 \\xa0 The Department of History currently offers two languages - Sanskrit and Persian. The objective \\xa0 \\xa0 \\xa0 \\xa0 \\xa0 \\xa0 \\xa0 \\xa0 \\xa0 \\xa0 \\xa0 \\xa0 \\xa0 \\xa0 for this is to equip History students for historical research in the future. The department \\xa0 \\xa0 \\xa0 \\xa0 \\xa0 \\xa0 \\xa0 \\xa0 \\xa0 \\xa0 \\xa0 \\xa0 \\xa0 \\xa0 \\xa0 strongly encourages its students to learn at least one of these languages while they are at \\xa0 \\xa0 \\xa0 \\xa0 \\xa0 \\xa0 \\xa0 \\xa0 \\xa0 \\xa0 \\xa0 \\xa0 \\xa0 \\xa0 \\xa0 \\xa0 Ashoka. Currently, \\u200b any \\u200b one language course (Persian/ Sanskrit) can count in lieu of \\u200b one History \\xa0 \\xa0 \\xa0 \\xa0 \\xa0 \\xa0 \\xa0 \\xa0 \\xa0 \\xa0 \\xa0 \\xa0 \\xa0 \\xa0 \\xa0 elective in the total course tally of History students. Beyond this, students can take as many \\xa0 \\xa0 \\xa0 \\xa0 \\xa0 \\xa0 \\xa0 \\xa0 \\xa0 \\xa0 \\xa0 \\xa0 \\xa0 \\xa0 \\xa0 \\xa0 language courses as they want. In future, the department will explore options for making more \\xa0 \\xa0 \\xa0 \\xa0 \\xa0 \\xa0 \\xa0 \\xa0 \\xa0 \\xa0 \\xa0 \\xa0 \\xa0 \\xa0 \\xa0 language courses available for its students. \\xa0 \\xa0 Language Courses currently on offer: \\xa0 \\xa0 Monsoon Semester: \\xa0 \\xa0 HIS-5511.

Overview 1.1 Degree Requirements at Ashoka To graduate with a Bachelor’s degree, students are required to pass courses that are broadly divided into three categories – Foundation Courses ,Major Courses (including Interdisciplinary Majors) andCo-Curricular Courses . First year students typically take foundation courses in the ﬁrst 3-4 semesters at Ashoka, and start taking Major courses from the 2nd semester. You also have the option to take up a completely different subject as a minor or a concentration in addition to your major. Minors and Concentrations are brief programs taken in disciplines other than your major. Minors at Ashoka require you to take 6 courses in a discipline, while a concentration requires 4 courses. 1.2 GPA and Credit System Please note that University-wise credit requirements are subject to change, and the latest requirements are always available on the ofﬁcial website . At Ashoka, each course carries credit points - foundation courses as well as major speciﬁc and minor courses typically earn a student 4 credit points , while co-curricular courses give 2 credit points . In order to earn their degree at the end of three years, students pursuing a pure major (such as Computer Science etc.) need to have accumulated a minimum of 100 credits . On the other hand, students pursuing an interdisciplinary major (such as CS and Entrepreneurship etc.) must fulﬁll a minimum of116 credits . A student’s performance in any academic course is graded on a letter scale (ranging from A to F). Each grade carries a grade point (such as an A gives 16 grade points, while an A- gives 14.8). On this basis, at the end of every semester a student’s cumulative grade point average (CGPA) and semester speciﬁc GPA are calculated. For more on this, please refer to the section on Awards and Recognition (3.6).6 Chapter 1. Overview 1.3 CS at Ashoka The Department of Computer Science at Ashoka University acknowledges the increasing relevance of computing and information science to every academic discipline. In addition to classical and emerging areas of Computer Science, students have an opportunity to study interdisciplinary areas like computational biology, social and information networks, digital humanities and data-driven journalism. 2 interdisciplinary majors, a minor, a concentration are also offered by the Department in addition to an undergraduate major in Computer Science and a Ph.D. in Computer Science. The goals of the programme include (but are not limited to): 1.Impart a deep understanding of the foundations of Computer Science 2.Enable a student to be able to systematically apply the foundational knowledge across disci- plines 3.Create new knowledge in the ﬁeld of Computer Science 1.3.1 Programs Offered •Undergraduate –Major –Interdisciplinary Major –Advanced Major–Minor –Concentration •PhD •Graduate Assistantship 1.3.2 Faculty and Research Interests •Ravi Kothari , Professor (HOD Com- puter Science) Machine Learning, Pattern Recognition, Data Mining and Big Data •Sudheendra Hangal , Professor of the Practice in Computer Science Human- Computer Interaction, Social Media and Personal Digital Archives •Manu Awasthi , Associate Professor Com- puter Architecture, Operating Systems, and Computers & Society •Anirban Mondal , Associate Professor Ur- ban Informatics (Smart Cities), Spatial Databases and Financial Analytics •Mahavir Jhawar , Assistant ProfessorCryptography, Block-chain and Network Security •Debayan Gupta , Assistant Professor Se- cure Computation, Cryptography, and Pri- vacy •Goutam Paul , Associate Professor (Visit- ing - Spring 2020, Monsoon 2018) Cryp- tology, Security, Information and Coding Theory, Quantum Information and Compu- tation •Subhash Bhalla , Professor (Visiting - Monsoon 2020, Spring 2021) Distributed Database Systems, New Query Languages For a complete list of all faculty (core and visiting) and PhD students pursuing CS at Ashoka, visit thedepartmental website .2.

Academic Opportunities 3.1 Complimentary Disciplines Computer Science is a very versatile subject - with applications transcending multiple disciplines. At Ashoka, we have 2 interdisciplinary courses in CS, along with Entrepreneurship and Mathematics. Apart from these, it is also common for students studying CS at Ashoka to enroll in courses from Mathematics, Economics, Physics and Biology. 3.2 Study Abroad Programs Note that, like any other program at Ashoka, the Study Abroad Programs are subject to changes. Kindly refer to the GESP website for the latest information. Additionally, contact the departmental HOD for further clariﬁcation regarding credit transfers Every summer, international summer schools offer undergraduate courses in different subjects and ﬁelds. These courses can be transferred (subject to faculty approval) to the total credits taken as Ashoka. The Ofﬁce of Global Education and Strategic Programmes (GESP) is available to students for assistance and counselling in the application process. Ashoka is currently partnered with Wellesley College, UC Berkeley, University of Pennsyl- vania, Yale University, King’s College London, University of Michigan, Penn Engineering, Sciences Po, and Trinity College Dublin . Students can also apply for research and internship opportunities abroad to get practical experience in their ﬁelds of interest through a competitive process. These opportunities are available in Lehigh University, NTU Singapore, Koç University etc. For any enquiries on the process of applying for a summer/semester abroad, kindly email studyabroad@ashoka.edu.in 3.3 Teaching Assistantships As a TF/TA, you would be responsible for grading quizzes, holding discussion sessions and doubt clearing ofﬁce hours, as well as helping with the logistics for classes. A prospective applicant can12 Chapter 3. Academic Opportunities apply to TA for only those courses which they have already studied in Ashoka in the past. While preference may be given to seniors, anyone is welcome to apply for TAship by approaching the professor directly. Some courses may have different procedures, so do conﬁrm it with the instructor. 3.4 Independent Study Modules (ISM) Independent Study Modules (ISM) are 4-credit research projects that provide students an opportunity to work closely with a faculty member. These projects can either be research that faculty members are already working on or any other research topic that students may be interested in. If interested, you can simply approach a faculty member through email prior to the start of the semester, requesting them for guidance through an ISM. These count towards your electives. 3.5 Research Opportunities with Professors If you are interested in CS Research, it is a great idea to start working as a Research Assistant (RA) under a faculty member. In order to do so, you will have to personally approach faculty members in their ofﬁce hours and enquire whether you can assist them on current projects. Before seeking RA roles, make sure to have prior knowledge about the research interests of your faculty member. The CS Society also has plans of creating a uniﬁed Undergraduate Research Opportunities Platform to ease out this process. 3.6 Awards and Recognition •Dean’s List: The Dean’s List at Ashoka for any given semester includes the names of all students who, in the courses they have taken that semester, have scored a GPA of 3.65 or above. The Dean’s List is awarded on a semester basis. •Latin Honors: Students who have achieved scholastic distinction may be awarded the bach- elor’s degree with Latin honors at graduation. Honors appear on the ofﬁcial transcript and diploma. The criteria for these honors is as follows: 1.Cum Laude (With Distinction) - GPA >3.6 2.Magna Cum Laude (With High Distinction) - GPA >3.75 3.Summa Cum Laude (With Highest Distinction) - GPA >3.9 •Academic Achievement Awards: Gold Silver and Bronze Awards are awarded respectively to the students attaining the Top 3 Major CGPAs during graduation. •Undergraduate Research Excellence Awards: Awarded to the graduating student with the best track record in academic research, evaluated on the basis of publications and thesis quality. •Service Excellence Awards: Awarded for extraordinary service in department building through various activities..4. CS Clubs and Societies 4.1 CS Society The Computer Science Society at Ashoka University was founded in 2016 to strengthen the emerging CS culture on campus. It is an academic society that aims to create opportunities and resources for all students interested in this ﬁeld through a host of activities. Past events include Mahavamsa - Ashoka’s ﬁrst programming contest, hackathons, cryptic hunts, talks and workshops. Students across majors and disciplines are welcome to join! The CS Society is currently undergoing major structural changes. These include: •Formation of sub-departments such as Competitive Programming ,Software Development , Machine Learning and Data Science as per the interests of the student members of the society. •Weekly training and mentor-ship programs , occasionally involving well qualiﬁed guest instructors. •Creating a uniﬁed portal for Undergraduate Research Opportunities - to bring interested undergraduates and faculty members, PhD students etc. together. •A larger presence on social media and public forums, including a public website and technical blogs. Reach out to us at cs.society@ashoka.edu.in.14 Chapter 4. CS Clubs and Societies 4.2 Women in Computing Society (WiCS) Founded by an Ashoka alumnus, Simran Bhuria, and launched on campus by Mrs. Rashmi Mohan, an ACM eminent speaker on 29th September 2016, Women in Computing Society is a small bunch of passionate students working towards making the CS culture at Ashoka a safer, healthier, and inclusive one. We also focus on supporting everyone in CS, especially womxn, academically and personally. We constantly work towards building a larger community of womxn in CS that is collaborative and supportive in nature. As an academic society, we organise talks, hackathons, cryptic hunts, workshops, problem-solving centered stalls and events, and reading groups. As a part of our larger vision of an inclusive community, we organise events focused on activism – blog posts, discussions on gender in academic spaces and sexism, sessions on building conﬁdence and tackling other challenges for womxn in STEM and movie screenings! 1.WiCS cryptic hunts: We have had multiple hunts since the inception of WiCS based on different themes in collaboration with other societies such as – Ashoka’s Philosophy Society, Ashoka’s Psychology Society, Sandhi (Ashoka’s Languages Society), Ashoka Society for Politics, etc. 2.Workshops: These are focused on tools and skills useful for students in CS and beyond. We have done workshops on Git, web development, programming for beginners (Programming without Code), Excel/Google Sheets etc. 3.Interactive sessions: Some of the sessions we have organised in the past: a session with Prof. Jennifer Widom, Stanford University at Ashoka (2018), a Capstone Student Panel Discussion with senior students and alumni, an open house for CS students focused on discussions around gender in academic spaces, mixers for CS womxn. 4.Problem-solving centered stalls at fests and Haats: These were our attempts at sharing the joy of solving puzzles and love for algorithms with others at Ashoka. 5.Hackathons, collaborative work sessions focused on competitive programming, and unwinding sessions. Reach out to us at wics@ashoka.edu.in. 4.3 Special CS Events •CS Mixer: The CS Mixer is a unique initiate undertaken by the Department of CS every year, intended primarily to introduce the CS freshers to the seniors and members of the faculty. It is a fun event where you get to interact with all the faculty members, seek quick advice, all while enjoying free food! •Mahavamsa: Mahavamsa is Ashoka’s ﬁrst coding contest. It is a 48 hour coding contest with lots of cash prizes to be won. The contest is open to all current students of Ashoka University. Beginners and non-CS majors are also encouraged to participate. All you need is basic programming knowledge in a language of your choice! The ﬁrst edition of Mahavamsa was held in Spring 2020 and the CS Society intends to make it a recurring event.5.

When in doubt, feel free to bug her with anything CS related. 5.2 Faculty Advice 5.2.1 General Advice Welcome to CS@Ashoka! Computer Science, goes the joke (hint: they’re not joking), has little to do with com- puters and is not really a science. If you really push me, I’d say that it is a study of processes, of understanding why and how things happen, and their inherent complexity: is one problem truly harder than another? E.g., is it more difﬁcult to ﬁnd a square root than a 3rd root? Why? (Maybe there’s an easy trick for one and we’re just being stupid.) Personally, I love this subject because it’s the closest thing to magic we have. We create our incantations (computer programs), prepare the appropriate sacriﬁces (sleep is the common currency used by undergraduates, I believe), and wave our wands (or macbooks dual-booting linux): our spells can travel across the world across the only planetary-scale infrastructure ever built by humanity, jumping across chains of electrons and photons in a system that stores (nearly) the sum total of human knowledge (and ignorance). Our spells can analyse your iris and detect diabetes well before any medical doctor could, and also tell the hospital how to best optimise their supplies; they can navigate our spacecraft across unimaginable distances and help us understand the universe; they can connect us all through social media and buoy industry through a pandemic via e-commerce. There’s a dark side as well - all things can be misused. I hope to teach you a lot about computer science. But I don’t just want well-trained worker bees: I want brilliant, nuanced thought; I want technical knowledge balanced by moral ﬁbre; but most of all, I want each and every one of you to become the very best human beings you can be (that, and understand pointers properly). PS. Yes, computer scientists tend to use more parentheses than most other people (and what’s wrong with that?). -Debayan Gupta , Assistant Professor, Ashoka University5.3 Post-Ashoka Journey 17 5.2.2 Book/ Resource Recommendation Textbooks/ Reference books recommended by Faculty: 1.Introduction to Algorithms by Cormen, Leiserson, Rivest, and Stein 2.The C Programming Language by Kernighan and Ritchie 3.The C++ Programming Language by Bjarne Stroustrup 4.Database System Concepts by Avi Silberschatz 5.Computational Complexity: A Modern Approach by Barak and Arora 6.Introduction to Modern Cryptography by Katz and Lindell 7.Cryptography and Network Security by Stallings 8.Compilers: Principles, Techniques, and Tools by Aho, Lam, Sethi, and Ullman 9.Artiﬁcial Intelligence: A Modern Approach by Norvig and Russell 10.Computer Networks by Tanenbaum 11.Computer Architecture: A Quantitative Approach by Hennessy and Patterson 12.Modern Processor Design by Shen and Lipasti Other fun reads: 1.Gödel, Escher, Bach by Douglas Hofstadter 2.I am a Strange Loop by Douglas Hofstadter 3.The Art of Computer Programming by Donald E.

Ashoka University offers a 3-month long summer break, which you can utilize productively by interning. It is advisable to search for summer internships at least 2-3 months prior to the start of the break - most ﬁrms or research centers have deadlines that you should research about as early as possible. Moreover, Ashoka University’s Career Development Ofﬁces (CDO) also provide internship opportunities through ﬁrms that recruit interns on campus. If you’re applying through CDO, keep your SuperSet proﬁle updated to avoid last-minute hassle. For CS speciﬁc internships, do occasionally brush up on your Data Structures and Algorithms . 5.3.2 On Letters of Recommendation from Faculty Graduation School applications often require letters of recommendation from faculty during the admissions process. An optimal letter-writer should ideally have you in at least one class or should have supervised you in research, thesis, or other work. Moreover, their contact with you should be relatively recent. You might also want to consider how well you performed in their class or work and whether you have had interactions with them outside of the classroom. Note that different professors may have different rules related to Letters of Recommendation, thus make it a point to get in touch with your desired letter-writer and clarify all details well in advanced. Also, approach the faculty at least 2 weeks in advanced for them to be prepared.18 Chapter 5. Additional Resources and Advice 5.3.3 Alumni Experiences in the Industry Barun Parruck (UG’19) Q:What does your current role at Google India entail? A:I’m a Software Engineer 2 at Google, speciﬁcally an iOS full stack developer within the Google One team. My day to day work involves ﬁxing bugs assigned to me, proposing and implementing new features, and writing unit tests for these features. Q:You were active on competitive programming websites. How helpful do you think that was in helping you secure an internship at Microsoft and the subsequent job offer? A:They were perhaps the main feature of how I got the internship. Getting the job offer from the internship was a completely different task, and primarily involved making extensive contributions to their codebase and presenting and demo’ing my additions constantly over the period of the internship. Q:During your time at Ashoka, what were your favorite courses? Other than Program- ming, what area of CS intrigued you the most? A:Software Debugging is probably the most useful course I’ve ever taken. Most of my interest lies in either algorithmic problem solving or full stack web development and software architecture. My favourite course was Databases and Data Mining (Debapriyo Majumdar), followed closely by Computer Organization and Systems (Vivek Seshadri) Q:Any pitfalls one should avoid while studying CS at Ashoka? A:Avoid taking too many courses (though deﬁnitely attend a single class of every single course, just in case you’re missing out on some exceptional professors). I think a lot of people get caught up with the idea that the goal is the submission of the assignment. I’ve had bad grades now and then - but I’ve tried my best to make sure that every assignment submitted wasn’t for the submission but for the content. And start early! :P Q:What advice would you give to undergraduates who wish to join the industry? A:Deﬁnitely I’d say you need to focus on getting your interviews right. I seem to do pretty well in traditional SWE interviews and a large part of that comes from my competitive programming background, as well as just grinding leetcode and practicing mock interviews a lot. If you don’t interview often, it’s quite likely that stress will act up and cause you to perform subpar. And reach out to seniors, professors, anybody - connections are important in the industry re: getting referrals. Participate in all the popular company recruitment drives like the Facebook Hacker cup, or the Google Code jam/kickstarter. And ﬁnally, you can always reach out to recruiters on Linkedin if you’ve got a decent proﬁle to be able to bring a more personal touch to the applications you make Barun Parruck is a Software Engineer at Google Inc. He was formerly a Software Engineer at Microsoft where he had also interned in his junior year. As a student, Barun was very active on competitive programming websites like Codeforces5.3 Post-Ashoka Journey 19 Nishka Dasgupta (ASP’19) Q:What does your current role at Microsoft Research Lab, India entail? A:I work as a Research Fellow. Under the guidance of my manager, I am currently trying to develop efﬁcient protocols in Multiparty Computation (MPC). Q:What do you think, helped you secure your current role? A:Both my previous summer internships had been research-focused, speciﬁcally on cryptography projects, so that certainly played a factor. By fortunate coincidence, my most recent internship before I applied had been in multiparty computation (MPC), and the manager whom I applied to work with was also interested in MPC at the time, so our research interests aligned. Having strong recommendations also helped. Q:How should one prepare for job/internship searches? A:While not every role will have the same requirements, there are some general best practises that have helped me. Cover your bases before any interview or exam; a lot of interviews, even for speciﬁc roles, often expect a breadth of basic knowledge anyway. Be prepared to network and ﬁnd out which of your professors (especially professors who have a positive impression of you) knows someone who knows someone who works at your dream company/university. Talk to your seniors, batchmates and professors as well, to learn about opportunities you would not have heard of otherwise (that’s how I learned about the RF programme at MSR). Don’t take rejection personally; focus on learning from your mistakes. Try not to bluff too hard about your interest or knowledge regarding any ﬁeld/professor unless you are prepared to put in the work until you really are as dedicated/knowledgeable as you claimed to be. Q:Any pitfalls one should avoid while studying CS at Ashoka? A:As most of the professors don’t really impose a speciﬁc language, it can be easy to get too comfortable with only one language. This is a mistake. Look for excuses to learn new languages or frameworks that you are not being forced to learn in a class, especially those popularly used in your preferred ﬁeld (e.g most big crypto projects are written in C/C++) or in the industry at large. Python is delightful up until your job interviewer asks you questions about memory errors in C. Although mathematics courses are not compulsory for CS at Ashoka, some ﬁelds (and grad schools) will expect certain courses (e.g a Linear Algebra requirement for AI focused programmes; a Number Theory requirement for theoretical crypto). If you have a preferred ﬁeld, do your research on what is needed (talk to relevant professors too) and plan your courses accordingly. Q:Any advice for undergraduates about the Industry? A:Long working hours are, unfortunately, the norm, whether in research or in development. Especially near deadlines, sleep can be hard to come by. So, start working on your ability to handle stress. In research speciﬁcally, you will often be expected to take the lead and start making suggestions instead of waiting for your mentor to tell you what to do next; if you have trouble with that, start practising. Nishka is a Research Fellow at Microsoft Research Labs, India. She has interned at Nanyang Technlogical University - Singapore, and Tata Institute of Fundamental Research - Mumbai, as an undergraduate researcher.20 Chapter 5. Additional Resources and Advice 5.3.4 Alumni Experiences in Higher Education Anavi Kajla (ASP’18) Q:You pursued your Masters in Human-Computer Interaction. How good a ﬁeld, in your opinion, is HCI for someone who wants to study Computer Science in sync with the Humanities? A:HCI is a highly interdisciplinary ﬁeld and can draw from virtually any discipline. A degree in CS and then going into HCI is highly beneﬁcial because you have a deeper understanding of software development and various technical constraints. Ultimately, any job in UX will involve a high degree of communicating with developers about the designs you create and knowing how they work gives you an advantage. Q:You have also interned at Amazon. What skills do such companies look for while hiring students who specialize in UI/UX? Do Data Structure and Algorithm skills take prece- dence? Or are Software Engineers who work on UI/UX projects evaluated differently? A:There are 4 paths someone interested in UI/UX can take: UX Designer, UX Engineer, Visual Designer and UX Researcher. Skills & evaluation depends on which role you’re interested in and usually doesn’t require knowledge of CS concepts we’re taught in our major. I would highly recommend looking up these specializations for a more in-depth understanding of what each role entails and where your interests/strengths lie. There are skills common to all these that employers typically look for: a portfolio of projects (super important!), storytelling skills, creative problem-solving and the ability to communicate well with others. In my case, I was exclusively an SDE and didn’t have much of a UI/UX component in my internship apart from working on a small front-end project. Q:What parameters would you advise an undergrad at Ashoka to focus on, if they wish to pursue graduate studies in Human-Computer Interaction? A:Since most CS classes at Ashoka have a project component in them, it would be beneﬁcial if students could go and talk to actual users of the product they’re building and get feedback on it! This would help them understand the importance/role of UX in product development and also, make for a great portfolio project. Apart from that, getting familiar with various prototyping tools (eg. Sketch, Figma) is a great place to start developing interaction & visual design skills. Some of these tools also offer students free plans! And, front-end skills are a bonus too. Q:Are there any pitfalls one should avoid while studying CS at Ashoka? A:The Ashoka CS department has grown a lot since I graduated and students should take advantage of the variety of classes offered to develop their interests. When I was attending, my batchmates & I would take whichever course was offered so we could complete our major! It didn’t afford us the ﬂexibility to take classes that we were genuinely interested in. Apart from one introductory HCI class in my second year, I wasn’t able to study more topics in the ﬁeld. But now hopefully you can!5.3 Post-Ashoka Journey 21 Q:What advice would you give to undergraduates who wish to eventually join the industry in a similar ﬁeld? A: –Try to involve users in your class projects early to get a feel of the work you’ll be doing as a UXer –Working on a portfolio takes time, so start early! (look here for inspiration) –Research the ﬁeld and it’s many specializations well before you decide to take the leap - it’s not for everyone Anavi is currently a product designer at the Library of Congress - USA. She pursued her Masters in Human Computer Interaction from the University of Maryland-College Park. She has also interned at Amazon as a Software Development Engineer Pratyush Ranjan Tiwari (ASP’20) Q:What are your current research interests? A:My main research area of interest is cryptography. My areas of interests within cryptography are veriﬁable computation, quantum cryptography, privacy-preserving techniques and funda- mentals of cryptography. I am particularly interested in designing protocols with minimal trust requirements. Q:What undergraduate research that you have undertaken are you the proudest of? A:Two main projects: a) Is the paper I published at IEEE Security and Privacy on the Blockchain titled CryptoWills, which is a protocol for secure and private last wills for cryptocurrencies. This allows for people’s funds in cryptocurrencies to be distributed to their loved ones after they passed away, this is a ﬁrst protocol solving that problem. b) Security & Privacy and attacks on Aadhaar: I worked on this with a big team of people at Ashoka under Prof. Debayan Gupta. My personal contribution was towards the cryptography used in Aadhaar, I devised the biggest attack on Aadhaar till date. The paper is embargoed and we are awaiting govt. permission to publish. Q:Any pitfalls one should avoid while studying CS at Ashoka? A:Don’t do things because other people think they’re cool. Find out for yourself if working for a big tech company will actually be your dream job. Since Ashoka is new and we don’t really get the FAANG companies to visit and hire, people at Ashoka CS often develop this fantasy for such jobs. Do internships to ﬁgure out what a career in a particular direction is like, do an internship with some startup in Bangalore/some other city in India (and abroad too if you can) to ﬁnd out what it’s like living that life. Intern at a university in India (and abroad too if you can) to ﬁgure out what life in academia is like. Bottomline, whatever possible career trajectories you want to try out, do that a lot, even if it costs you some grades (tbh, don’t drop below 3.5 tho).Start looking for internships for the next summer from August, ask professors to connect you with people. After the summer before 4th year you can basically have a plan then on what to do next. Finding jobs/grad schools etc. will take a year and thats’ what the22 Chapter 5. Additional Resources and Advice 4th year is for. Try different dept. at Ashoka and their courses, doing interdisciplinary things opens new doors career wise. Only work with people you enjoy working with. Don’t fall into the classic CS stereotype, and be healthy, well rounded and don’t let your major be your identity. Q:How should one prepare for Grad School applications? A:Once you know you’re applying the most important aspects are 1.Published papers/pre-prints : Pre-prints are fully written papers which are not yet accepted for publishing. This is the easiest foot-in-the-door from the perspective of admission committees. If you don’t have this yet, I would suggest getting at least a pre-print worthy research idea, working on it and then applying. 2.Recommendation: Only ask people who will recommend you 110% positively, make you look awesome. Try to get someone very successful in your research area/ﬁeld to write a rec, this person should be preferably from outside Ashoka. The way to do this is to get internships with people like this and then working super hard to impress them. 3.Grades: Sorry but yes, the higher your grades the better your chances in general. However, everything above a 3.8 is the same. The big brackets I would say are a) 3.8+ b) 3.5+ c) 3.2+ d) apply later. In case of d) do something awesome to stand out, like publish a paper at a top venue to stand out, work somewhere popular, get a recommendation from someone who is super popular in the ﬁeld and only then apply. Or go to an okayish place for a Master’s and then improve. Q:Any advice for undergraduates about the higher studies in CS? A:If you haven’t done any research, then don’t go to grad school. Only go to grad school if you’ve worked on research problems, and know that you want to take advanced courses and also do more research. Don’t go if you’re unsure/ because don’t have anything else lined up. Ideally you should pay 0 for grad school, and arguably go only when you don’t have to pay. Pratyush is a passionate cryptographer, pursuing his PhD from John Hopkins University. He was also accepted to NYU’s Courant School of Mathematics. His internship experience includes research roles at Indian Institute of Technology-Madras, Chennai Mathematical Institute, Dunya Labs, and Celo-Berlin.5.3 Post-Ashoka Journey 23 Vineet Reddy (ASP’20) Q:You were accepted to some very reputed departments like NYU Tandon and UChicago. What path did you tread as an undergraduate that helped you secure these? A:I think having a solid research/project experience in your undergrad really sets you apart from other students. Keep in mind that Ashoka CS still does not have the same reputation as that of other programs in India (think IIT’s IIIT’s and BITS). I think focusing on this can be really useful when one is applying to graduate programs. Also, developing good rapport with your professors helps as you’ll need their references when you start applying. Q:According to you, what sets someone apart when applying to universities for a Masters in CS? A:From what our professors have told me - SoP and your LoRs seem to matter, by far, the most. While your GPA is important, most of the time, it your SoP and LoRs that set you apart from every other applicant. Stufﬁng them with solid references and good content should really help. Q:What is the next ’big’ thing you aspire to achieve? A:Ideally, work as a Software Developer in one of the Big 4 tech companies. Something long term would be to retire as soon as possible! Trust me, slogging off at work sucks. Q:Any pitfalls one should avoid while studying CS at Ashoka? A:One of the biggest pitfalls I noticed coming from an engineering program was how the education for most CS majors ends with the classroom. Most of the stuff I picked up was by doing random side projects and messing around with some popular libraries. Don’t just do what your courses tell you to, pick up random stuff and just work on it – you’ll probably learn a lot more than what your courses teach. Q:Any advice for undergraduates about the higher studies in CS? A:Work hard in Discrete Math and Algorithms! They’re super important courses that I should have paid a lot more attention to. Don’t worry too much about your grades, they’ll be ﬁne as long as you put in a bit of effort. Don’t just be a one trick pony – learn more than Python. Most of all, enjoy your time at Ashoka, it’s going to be great. Vineet is a Machine Learning Enthusiast, and was accepted to Masters programs at the New York University, University of Chicago, University of Massachusetts Amherst, and University of Maryland. Due to the ongoing COVID-19 crisis, he has decided to defer his admit to the next year. He’s currently working as a software development engineer at EACIIT - a Singapore based Big Data Analytics leader.24 Chapter 5. Additional Resources and Advice Aditya Singh (ASP’20) Q:What is the most important advice you would give juniors who wish to get into top Masters programs? A:I think the most important thing is to actively engage with the material and faculty while taking courses. Before making the decision to apply for further studies, it’s important to be clear about what one would like to study further. Personally, being involved in various different projects helped me in identifying the areas I really wanted to focus on and pursue further. Q:According to you, which aspect of your application was most instrumental in you getting accepted into top universities? A:Applying for postgraduate studies is a pretty holistic process so pinpointing one single aspect is difﬁcult. I think having industry exposure along with some research experience is helpful as it shows versatility, which then also reﬂects in the recommendations. Doing decently well on standardized tests is essential as they act as a virtual cutoff for some universities. The statement of purpose is also as important as anything else and should be thoroughly reviewed. Q:Any pitfalls one should avoid while studying CS at Ashoka? A:I can’t say in general, but in my experience, I found that it’s easy to become a little disconnected and solely grade obsessed at Ashoka, which is a detrimental mindset to have. Making the effort to interact and grow with not only your professors, but also your peers, goes a long way in helping you get the most out of the time you spend here. Q:How would you compare research experience and industry internships when it comes to applying to Masters programs in grad schools? A:I think it really depends on the sort of programs and universities one is targeting. For more theoretical and research-based programs I emphasized my research experience with professors at Ashoka and outside, whereas for programs that are also directed towards the industry (like data science, information systems, etc.) I put more emphasis on the internships. The recommendation letters also varied correspondingly. Again, it’s helpful to identify the area one would like to pursue, and plan the summer/winter commitments accordingly. Q:As you will be studying Computational Data Science at CMU, what is the most impor- tant skill people interested in Data Science must cultivate? A:I think the most important skill to cultivate would be to keep your fundamentals in mathematics strong, especially in subjects like linear algebra and real analysis. One might be able to intuitively understand how CNNs look for features across visual data, but knowing how the process of Stochastic Gradient Descent works is as important. Aditya plans to attend Carnegie Mellon University for an MS in Computational Data Science. He was also accepted to other reputed universities like University of Massachusetts-Amherst and University of Maryland. He was formerly a Research Intern at ISRO and Indian Institute of Technology- Gandhinagar5.4 Useful Contacts 25 5.4 Useful Contacts •To contact any student (batch mate/senior/alumni) at Ashoka, it is convenient to use the Ashoka Email. The general syntax of one’s email is <ﬁrstname>.<lastname>_<batch>@ashoka.edu.in and you can use this format to look up/ contact anyone at Ashoka. Keep in mind that if one has multiple active email addresses, you will need to use your discretion, as follows: –If one has separate aspandugemails, contact them on their latest email (i.e aspin this case). Similarly, contact alumni on their alumni email ID. –Contact your TAs and TFs on their TA IDs, and not their personal emails, for course- related queries - makes their lives easier •If you do now know who to contact for anything remotely related to Computer Science, you should probably contact the CS Representative ﬁrst. For Monsoon 2020, the CS Representative is –Sehajpreet Kaur ( sehajpreet.kaur_ug21@ashoka.edu.in ) •All Ashoka faculty can be contacted using the Ashoka Email.

      "{'page_content': \"    \\u200b DEPARTMENT OF PHILOSOPHY    STUDENTS’ HANDBOOK             DISCLAIMER: \\u200b If any information presented in this handbook is in conflict with any       information provided on the department website    ( \\u200b https://www.ashoka.edu.in/page/philosophy-115 \\u200b ), then the information on the    department website should be considered correct and final.  About the Department  Philosophy grapples with fundamental questions about the nature of reality, knowledge, and how       we ought to act. Whether in the Indian or Western tradition, answers to these questions have         been supported by rigorous arguments. Our courses offer a historically sensitive immersion in       these arguments. Nevertheless, the philosophy major at Ashoka University aims to equip       students to work beyond the parochialism of either the Indian or Western philosophical tradition        to do philosophy without boundaries.  The philosophy major will equip students with critical reasoning and analytical problem-solving       skills, expressive precision, and the intellectual spaciousness to appreciate and engage rationally       with arguments and points of view with which they profoundly disagree. The Ashoka Philosophy        graduate will be well prepared for higher studies in philosophy or a career in e.g. media, law,         business, or consulting.  People  Current Faculty Members  1.

Philosophy Minor  The requirements for a minor in philosophy are as follows (6 courses):  1. Introduction to Philosophy; Category: RC (Offered every spring semester)  2. Symbolic Logic; Category: RC (Offered every monsoon semester) 3. 1 course categorised as IN (Non-western Philosophy requirement) 4. 1 course categorised as HW (History of Western Philosophy requirement) 5. 1 course categorised as CC (Contemporary Core requirement)  6. 1 elective course (These can be from any of the following categories: HW/IN/CC/EO)  Any students completing a minor in philosophy should complete 24 credits in PHI category        courses, that is, they must complete 6 four-credit courses in philosophy.  Philosophy Concentration  The requirements for a concentration in philosophy are as follows (4 courses):  1. Introduction to Philosophy; Category: RC (Offered every spring semester)  2. Symbolic Logic; Category: RC (Offered every monsoon semester) 3. 2 courses (These can be from any of the following categories: HW/IN/CC/EO)**  **The courses cannot be from the same category. For eg: If the first course is from IN, the other          course should be from CC, HW, or EO.  Any students completing a concentration in philosophy should complete 16 credits in PHI       category courses, that is, they must complete 4 four-credit courses in philosophy.  PPE Major with Philosophy Concentration  The philosophy course requirement for a PPE major with a concentration in philosophy are as follows (8 courses):  1. Introduction to Philosophy; Category: RC (Offered every spring semester)  2. Symbolic Logic; Category: RC (Offered every monsoon semester) 3. 1 course categorised as IN (Non-western Philosophy requirement) 4. 1 course categorised as HW (History of Western Philosophy requirement) 5. 1 course categorised as CC (Contemporary Core requirement)  6. 3 elective course (These can be from any of the following categories: HW/IN/CC/EO)  Any students completing a PPE major should complete 32 credits in PHI category courses, that        is, they must complete 4 four-credit courses in philosophy.  PPE Major without Philosophy Concentration  The minimum philosophy coursework requirement for a PPE major in philosophy are as follows (4 courses):  1. Introduction to Philosophy; Category: RC (Offered every spring semester)  2. Symbolic Logic; Category: RC (Offered every monsoon semester) 3. 2 courses (These can be from any of the following categories: HW/IN/CC/EO)**  **The courses cannot be from the same category. For eg: If the first course is from IN, the other          course should be from CC, HW, or EO.  Any students completing a PPE major should complete at least 16 credits in PHI category        courses, that is, they must complete 4 four-credit courses in philosophy.  If a student on a track to completing a PPE major wants to take more courses in philosophy          beyond the minimum requirements, they can do so. The other courses can be from HW, IN, CC,         or EO category. However, such students are advised to get in touch with the PPE department or         their academic advisor to ensure that they are completing all other requirements for the PPE        degree.  A student cannot complete both a PPE major and a minor in philosophy.  FAQs  1. Do I need to take the philosophy courses in some specific order?  Prima facie, no. However, higher-division philosophy courses sometimes have     prerequisites - students are advised to check with the course instructor for such       prerequisites. Moreover, doing philosophy requires rigorous skill in reading a text      closely, writing critically, logical analysis, and sound argumentation. These skills are      often acquired in lower-division courses and it is advisable (but not obligatory) to take        the Introduction to Philosophy and the Symbolic Logic courses before taking      higher-division classes in philosophy.  2. Can I do a thesis before my fourth year (ASP)?  Yes, that is possible. But it will count as an Independent Study Module (ISM).  3. I am not a philosophy major. I want to complete a philosophy thesis in my ASP year. Can          I do so?  Yes, that is possible - all you need to do is find a professor who is willing to supervise          your work. However, it is recommended that you should take some philosophy courses       before doing a thesis.  4. I am taking a philosophy course. I do not know whether it is listed as RC/         IN/HW/CC/EO. How do I find out?  This is easy - just go to the department website page and click on course archive section         ( \\u200b https://www.ashoka.edu.in/page/philosophy-115 \\u200b ).  5. Is there a possibility to get a waiver for any of my degree requirements?  Yes, there is a possibility. You need to discuss with your academic advisor and the Head         of the Department of Philosophy.  6. My question is not listed here. Whom should I approach?

Through a comprehensive grounding in the foundations of the discipline, we shall examine the natur e, distribution and dynamics of power – both at the macro level of national and international politics and also at the micro level of the individual, family and community. We will map the ways in which knowledge systems and challenges to particular power r elations have been constructed over specific vectors of time and space. We will study both Aristotle and Plato, Gandhi and Iqbal; complementing studies on comparative politics with an exploration of South Asia politics. The Political Science undergraduate curriculum at Ashoka exposes students early on to research methodologies, both qualitative (the ethnographic methods and qualitative modes of political analysis) and quantitative (statistics, political data handling, data visualization). Some of our course s put a lot of emphasis on experiential learning through fieldwork and field trips. Faculty Members : ● Ali Khan Mahmudabad ● Bann Seng Tan ● Gilles Verniers ● Malvika Maheshwari ● Matthew Baxter ● Madhav Khosla ● Neelanjan Sircar ● Pratap Bhanu Mehta ● Vinay Sitapati (Head of Department) ● Priyamvada Trivedi (Visiting)  Requirements for Major: Each student will take a total of 12 courses towards the major.

Out of those eight, four courses are mandatory, while rest four will be electives (4 required courses + 4 electives). The required courses from the Political Science side are:  ● Western Political Thoughts (I) or Introduction to Political Theory ● Introduction to Comparative Politics ● Introduction to Indian Politics ● Quantitative Research Methods or Qualitative Research Methods (in either Sociology & Anthropology or Political Science) ● Four electives in Political Science (including a maximum of 2 cross -listed courses)  Requirements for Major in Politics, Philosophy and Economics (PPE):  Each student needs to take a total of sixteen courses, out of which one needs to take a minimum of four courses in Political Science. If a student takes a minimum of eight courses in Political Science, then it would qualify for a Degree in PPE with a speci alization in Political Science. The mandatory courses from the Political Science side are (3 + 1/5):  ● Western Political Thoughts (I) or Introduction to Political Theory ● Introduction to Comparative Politics ● Introduction to Indian Politics ● One elective in Political Science (4)/Five electives in Political Science (8)  4 Note: In case of 4 courses in Political Science, a student can take a maximum of 1 cross -listed course. In case of 8 courses in Political Science, a student can take a maximum of 2 cross - listed courses.  Structure for the ASPs (4th Years):  For obtaining an Advanced Diploma in Political Science, students need to submit an initial statement of interest in April in their 3rd year, with the name of the preferred advisor(s). This state ment of interest should approximately be of two pages, highlighting preliminary details about the project. By the beginning of the ensuing summer break, students will be matched to an advisor, who may assist in structuring a thesis project over the summer.  In the first week of courses in the Monsoon semester of the 4th year, students will be expected to submit a thesis proposal that is 3000 -5000 words. These proposals will be assessed by the appointed advisor and a department -selected second reader (who is not an advisor) for quality, feasibility and clarity. Students will be given feedback on the proposal by the second week of courses, with one of three decisions: (i) reject , (ii) revise and resubmit , or (iii) pass . If the student is given a pass, then she or he may continue to the thesis program without qualification. If the student is given a revise and resubmit , then she or he may continue to the thesis program conditional on completing the requested revisions within one week. If the student is given a reject , then she or he may not continue into the thesis program.  Upon gaining entry into the thesis program, there are four requirements for the year:  • Attendance at a Year -Long Thesis Semin ar • End of Monsoon Semester Presentation • Final Thesis Presentation (End of Spring Semester) • Final Thesis Submission  The grading scheme across these requirements and relevant schedules will be shared with students before course enrollment commences for the Monsoon Semester. The final thesis will be graded by the advisor(s) and a department -selected second reader (who is not an advisor).  The thesis will be for 8 credits overall (4 in each semester). Students are expected to take at least three courses (12 credits) in Political Science during their advanced ma jor. They can also choose to TA for Political Science courses instead of an elective and gain credits. Beware that TAships are either for 2 credits or 4 credits so make sure that your credits tally properly. The number of credits for TAship is determined b y the faculty before the term. The department advises students to TA for only one course in a semester.  Additionally, each student will be provided a fixed research budget, which can be claim ed upon incurring the expenses. Additional budget can be provided upon request to the advisor and the Head of the Department.   5 Course Levels and Pre -requisites :  Generally, the 100 level courses are entry -level or introductory courses, while the 300 level courses are advanced. The department doesn’t impose a sequence of course as per the level, but strongly recommends that you clear entry -level courses before takin g advanced level courses. Some advanced electives will require you to take Quantitative Research Methods as a prerequisite.  For example (non -exhaustive list):  ● Quantitative Research Methods 2 : Students must have completed Quantitative Research Methods 1. ● Theoretical Political Economy : Students should have completed Quantitative Research Methods 1. They should have either completed or be enrolled in Quantitative Research Methods 2. ● Empirical Political Economy : Students should have completed Quantitative Re search Methods 1. They should have either completed or be enrolled in Quantitative Research Methods 2.  In the event that a course apart from these has some pre -requisites, it will be communicated at the starting of the semester.

No. Q4: How many 100/200/300 level courses do I need to take?  6 There is no such requirement to take a specific number of courses of each level. Only the required courses are mandatory and can be taken in any sequence, irrespective of levels.  Q5: I’m going on a semester abroad. Can I substitute the required courses with a summer abroad course?  No. Required courses cannot be not substituted by summer courses.  Q6: Are Political Ideologies and WPT II compulsory courses?  No. Q7: What if I have done Political Ideologies/Introduction to Political Theory/Dynamics of State Formation in the past as a part of the requirement?  In case you have done Political Ideologies in Spring 2017 or Introduction to Political Theory in Spring 2018, you need not do WPT I. If you have done Dynamics of State Formation with Prof. Vinay Sitapati in the past, you fulfill the requirement for Introduction to Indian Politics. However, if you pursue these courses in any other semester, they will coun t only as electives and not as requirements , except for Introduction to Political Theory .  Q8: Can I take Political Ideologies/Introduction to Political Theory (electives) if I have done WPT I (required course) and vice versa?  Yes. Q9: Is WPT a pre -requ isite for WPT II?  No. We do recommend that you take WPT II after WPT I, but it’s not a pre -requisite.  Q10: Can I take a methods course in any other discipline?  Yes, you can, with validation from Prof. Sircar for quantitative courses and from the HoD for qualitative courses. In any case, you have to inform the HoD, the OAA and the Department Manager about this change.  Q11: How many cross -listed courses can I take?  Cross -listed courses are those courses which arise out of a discipline different from Political Science but are cross -listed with Political Science. Students can take upto two cross -listed course in a ny semester , provided all other rules are satisfied . The following is a summary of the rules around cross -listed courses:  ● Pure Major in Political Science: Maximum 3 ● ID Major in Politics and Society : Maximum 2 ● ID Major in PPE with 8 courses in Political Science: Maximum 2 7 ● ID Major in PPE with 4 courses in Political Science: Maximum 1 ● Concentration in Pol itical Science: Maximum 1 ● Minors in Political Science: Maximum 2  Q12: How can I get a course from another department cross -listed?  Write to the professor teaching that course to express your individual interest. Request the professor to directly email the course syllabus to the Head of Department, Political Science. The department will then take a collective decision , communicate with the professor directly , and then in form the students.  Q 13: I took a course which was cross -listed with Political Science. It is being offered again but is not showing as cross -listed. Is this a problem?  No. It is normal for courses to not be cross -listed with other departments in every semester that they’re offered. If you took a course, which was cross -listed in the semester that you took it, it will count towards your degree. Please cross -check the course code of such courses in your LMS.  Q14: Can I write a thesi s in the third year?  No. Only ASPs can write a thesis with the department. But you can do an ISM (Independent studies Module) with faculty. Some faculty offer ISMs – individual or group -based – others take proposals from students.  Q15: I’m interested in TAing for the Spring semester. How should I proceed?  Only ASP students are eligible to TA for courses. The department notifies all ASPs of TA requirement at the beginning of the semester and calls for applications. But in recent years there has been a scarcity of courses available for TA -ship. So students are advised not to depend upon it.  Q16: Can 4th year students opt out of an advanced major at a later stage  Yes, provided you fulfil other requirements meant for graduation.  Q17: Can students re -take the same course to get a higher grade.  Yes, but this is at the discretion of the professor offering the course. In case the new course is being offered by another professor (for example, because the original professor has left), the decision lies with the professor of the new course.  Q18: Whom should I contact for further queries?  8 You can email them to the Student Representative Vaibhav Parik <vaibhav.parik_asp21@ashoka.edu.in> or the Department Manager Anjali Panwar at anjali.panwar @asho ka.edu.in .

Studies show that the majority of innovative products and services in an economy evolve from entrepreneurial ventures. By providing knowledge and skills important to the creation and leadership of such startups, the Entrepreneurship Concentration within the Computer Science Program at Ashoka University will aim to train the founders and leaders of tomorrow’s high-tech ventures. The program is designed specifically for students who want to be tech-entrepreneurs. Courses are approached from the perspective of the student whose primary interest is in technological innovation, whose primary concentration is on science courses, and who has little or no prior business education.  The curriculum structure for the Bachelor’s Degree programme in Computer Science and Entrepreneurship follows that of the University’s standard undergraduate programme curriculum structure. To earn a Bachelor’s degree, each student will be required to complete a total of 28 courses over the programme period of 3 years of 2 semesters each. The programme will require 16 courses in the major papers/subjects. Foundational papers/subjects will constitute the remaining coursework for the student, adding up to 12 courses.     Introduction to Computer Programming is the first course in our series introducing students to computer science. In this class you will learn the fundamentals of computer programming in Java, with emphasis on applications in science and engineering. You will also learn about the broader field of computer science and algorithmic thinking, the fundamental approach that computer scientists take to solving problems. This course tightly integrates the theory and applications of discrete probability, discrete stochastic processes, and discrete statistical inference in the study of computer science. The course will introduce the Minimum Description Length Paradigm to unite basic ideas about randomness, inference and computation. Students will be expected to use the Maple programming environment in homework exercises which will include numerical and symbolic computations, simulations, and graphical displays. This course focuses on advanced topics in modern computer architecture, illustrated by recent case studies. Topics include fundamentals of quantitative analysis; pipelined, out-of-order, and speculative execution; superscalar, VLIW and vector processors; embedded processors; memory hierarchy design; thread-level parallelism; multiprocessors and multi-core architectures, synchronization and cache coherence protocols. This course introduces some of the formal tools of computer science, using a variety of applications as a vehicle. You’ll learn how to encode data so that when you scratch the back of a DVD, it still plays just fine; how to distribute “shares” of your floor’s PIN so that any five of you can withdraw money from the floor bank account (but no four of you can); how to play chess; and more. Topics that we’ll explore along the way include: logic and proofs, number theory, elementary complexity theory and recurrence relations, basic probability, counting techniques, and graphs. Design and implementation of operating systems. Topics include process synchronization and interprocess communication, processor scheduling, memory management, virtual memory, interrupt handling, device management, I/O, and file systems. Hands-on study of Linux operating system design and kernel internals, including work with Android devices. Experience with commercial virtualization tools and open source software. This course is an introduction to models of computation, computability, and complexity. We will ask questions like: How do we define the abstract notion of “computation” or a “computer”? What problems can be computed? What problems can be computed efficiently? Can we prove that some problems can never be computed, no matter how fast our computers become? The course is highly mathematical and abstract; in particular, there will be minimal programming assignments (if any) and homework problems will frequently involve proving or disproving various assertions. Students are expected to be comfortable with the material covered in Discrete Math or the equivalent. Topics (not exhaustive): automata and the languages they define, context-free grammars and the languages they define, Turing machines, basic complexity theory (such as P vs. NP). Complete data structures and algorithms course. The course teaches the following topics : Objects and ADTs, Constructors and destructors, Data Structure , Methods, Pre- and post-conditions C conventions, Error Handling, Arrays, Lists, Stacks, Stack Frames, Recursion, Sequential Searches, Binary Search , Trees, Complexity, Queues, Priority Queues , Heaps, Bubble , Heap Sort, Quick Sort , Bin Sort, Radix Sort, Searching Revisited, Red-Black trees, AVL trees, General n-ary trees, Hash Tables, Dynamic Algorithms, Fibonacci Numbers , Binomial Coefficients, Optimal Binary Search Trees, Matrix Chain Multiplication, Longest Common Subsequence, Optimal Triangulation , Graphs , Minimum Spanning Tree , Dijkstra’s Algorithm , Huffman Encoding , FFT , Hard or Intractable Problems, Eulerian or Hamiltonian Paths , Travelling Salesman’s Problem. How do you optimally encode a text ?le? How do you ?nd shortest paths in a map? How do you desgin a communication network? How do you route data in a network? What are the limits of ef?cient computation? This course gives a comprehensive introduction to design and analysis of algorithms, and answers along the way to these and many other interesting computational questions. You will learn about problem-solving; advanced data structures such as universal hashing and red-black trees; advanced design and analysis techniques such as dynamic programming and amortized analysis; graph algorithms such as minimum spanning trees and network ?os; NP-completeness theory; and approximation algorithms. What makes a programming language like “Python” or like “Java?” This course will look past superficial properties (like indentation) and into the soul of programming languages. We will explore a variety of topics in programming language construction and design: syntax and semantics, mechanisms for parameter passing, typing, scoping, and control structures. Students will expand their programming experience to include other programming paradigms, including functional languages like Scheme and ML. How does Google always understand what it is you’re looking for? How does Amazon.com figure out what items you might be interested in buying? How can categories of similar politicians be identified, based on their voting patterns? These questions can be answered via data mining, a field of study at the crossroads of artificial intelligence, database systems, and statistics. Data mining concerns itself with the goal of getting a computer to learn or discover patterns, especially those found within large datasets. We’ll focus on techniques such as classification, clustering, association rules, web mining, collaborative filtering, and others. This course focuses on investigating, understanding, and implementing the process of founding a start-up firm. Elements of searching out new venture opportunities, matching skills with a new venture, financing, competitive strategy, intellectual property, and operating a new venture will be explored. The focus of the course will be the development and presentation of a business plan created by teams of students with various academic backgrounds. This course is designed to help students develop their knowledge, confidence, skills, and self-image necessary to pursue entrepreneurial ventures in such domains as business, government, and public service. It provides a foundation in the fundamentals of entrepreneurial leadership, as well as a source of inspiration and energy in the art and science of taking visions and bringing them to reality. Entrepreneurship is innovation in practice: transforming ideas into opportunities, and, through a deliberate process, opportunities into commercial realities. These entrepreneurial activities can take place in two contexts: the creation of new organizations; and within existing organizations. This course will present an entrepreneurial framework for these entrepreneurial processes, supported by case studies that illustrate essential elements. Successful entrepreneurs and expert practitioners will be introduced who will highlight practical approaches to entrepreneurial success. This course focuses on institutional and product marketing methods used by start-up to medium-sized companies. After an overview of basic marketing principles, the course will cover the spectrum from day-to-day marketing activities of the entrepreneurial business to positioning and strategy. Students will learn to analyze, formulate, and implement marketing strategy, and learn the fundamentals of market research, pricing, and reaching and selling to customers. This course focuses on understanding how to construct the data and find appropriate financing for a start-up venture. Various forms of financing are introduced: vendor financing, factoring, etc. Through a medley of tests, case studies, and team exercises, students exercise basic financial skills such as financial statement formulation, NPV analysis and scenario analysis. This course focuses on the key components of starting a venture-scalable high-tech business. The course will examine the full life cycle of a startup; from opportunity assessment and market sizing to R&D and operation plans and go-to-market and distribution strategy. The course will also cover venture capital, legal considerations and team building. The role of angel investors, venture capitalists, and non-dilutive funding will be covered in depth. Student teams will write and present a business plan to active venture capitalists.

FAQs      20         2 Introduction Physics is a doorway to some of the most beautiful and profound phenomena in the universe like black holes, supernovae, Bose -Einstein condensates, superconductors. It is, simultaneously, a driver of lifestyle -changing technology, e.g., engines, electricity, and transistors; and a powerful way of perceiving and analyzing problems that can be applied in various domains, both within and outside standard physics. The beauty and profundity of the phenomena studied by physicists offer romance and excite passion, and the utility of its discoveries and th e power of its methods arouse interest.  These methods can be very intricate and demanding: theoretical physics requires a skilful combination of physical and mathematical thinking, and experimental physics requires in addition the ability to turn tentati ve ideas into physical devices that can put those ideas to the test. As a result, the successful practice of physics demands rigour, flexibility, mechanical adroitness, persistence, and great imagination. The physicist’s imagination is nourished not just b y physics but also by other areas of human enquiry and thought, of the kind that an Ashoka undergraduate is expected to encounter.  With all of this in mind, the physics programme has been designed to: (i) allow students wishing to major in physics to discov er real physics and make a wise choice, in the first year; (ii) provide, throughout, a thorough training in fundamental physics; (iii) bring together everything learnt earlier, and give students the option to pursue more advanced courses in physics or branch out into other areas, in the third year. The idea is to accompany those wishing to become professional physicists as they take the f irst steps in that direction, and to introduce everyone who goes through the programme to the physicist’s way of thinking.     3 Physics Major – Typical Trajectory Semester 2: Discovering UG -level Physics A student wishing to major, minor, or pursue a concentration in Physics is expected to take the introductory course in calculus (Calculus I) offered by the Mathematics Department. Students wishing to major in Physics should plan to take it in their first s emester.  Requirement for Physics major : 13 core physics courses + 2 electives (60 credits)  The physics -major sequence begins in semester 2, with two courses, one in theoretical physics and the other in experimental physics. The first purpose of these c ourses is to provide an experience of UG level physics on the basis of which a student can decide whether or not to major in physics, i.e., they are gateway courses. The second purpose of these courses is to serve as an introduction to the physicist’s way of thinking about problems and solving them, something that has proved useful not just to physicists but also to those in other disciplines that make use of quantitative methods and experiments, e.g., mathematics, computer science, economics, psychology, a nd biology.  Semester 3, 4 and 5: The Physics Core  The physics courses in these 3 semesters form the core of the physicist’s undergraduate canon. Anyone majoring in physics is expected to be thorough in these areas. Each semester has 2 -3 theory courses and an accompanying lab.  Semester 6: Exploring more advanced options  The student can opt for elective courses: each student majoring in physics is required to take at least two. From the student’s point of view, the electives chosen is likely to indicate a post -graduate direction – towards theoretical physics, towards experimental physics or perhaps away from physics into an allied discipline that would benefit from training in physics.        4 Physics Minor or Concentration  To Minor in physics a student must do six courses in physics (24 credits). Of these the two gateway courses – MP1 and Lab 1 – are compulsory. At least two more courses should be taken from among the core courses offered in semesters 3, 4, and 5, provided a ppropriate prerequisites have been satisfied for these courses (recommended courses: Classical Mechanics and Thermal Physics).  The remaining two may be either other compulsory or elective courses offered by the Physics Department or cross -listed with Phy sics, provided appropriate prerequisites have been satisfied. In place of one elective course, a student may take an Independent Study Module (ISM) of equivalent credit.  For a Concentration in physics a student must do six courses in physics (16 credits ). Of these the two gateway courses – MP1 and Lab 1 – are compulsory.  At least two more courses should be taken from among the core courses offered in semesters 3, 4, and 5, provided appropriate prerequisites have been satisfied for these courses (recomm ended courses: Classical Mechanics and Thermal Physics)          5 General Information on the Physics Courses Mathematical level — All theory courses are calculus -based. The level of mathematical sophistication will increase progressively. The mathematical - physics courses will be application -oriented rather than proof -oriented. Familiarity with +2 level physics and mathematics is a ssumed.  Labs — All lab courses will involve extensive use of instruments to make observations. These experiments will in general illustrate ideas studied in the accompanying theory courses.  The use of computers — Many theory courses will include computa tional exercises, generally using the programming language Python. Labs will also require the use of computers.  Duration — Theory courses: two lectures a week each lasting 1.5 hours. In addition, there may be a 1.5 -hour tutorial per week . Laboratory: one 3 -hour main lab session per week and one 3 -hour extra session per week for lab course.  List of Physics Courses Compulsory/Core Courses Mathematical Physics 1 (Gateway course: semester 2) This course aims to familiarise the student with a variety of mathematical techniques which every student of physics should be conversant with. Having taken the course, you should be comfortable with casting a wide variety of physics problems in mathematical language and being able to analyse and solve them subsequently. The course will also include an introduction to programming with Python. Within the physics curriculu m at Ashoka university, this course is an essential prerequisite for Classical Mechanics and Electricity and Magnetism in Light of Relativity offered in the third semester.  Pre-requisites: Students who have not done mathematics at the 12th -grade level are required to take Calculus I.     6 Physics Lab 1 (Gateway course: semester 2) An introduction to physics through experiments. The goal of this introductory lab is to help students develop the skills needed for experimental physics. Students will be introduced to the basic concepts of data collection, analysis, and interpretation over the span of the course by working on different experimental problems which have been carefully selected to represent different branches of physics.  Pre-requis ites: none.  Classical Mechanics (semester 3) Newtonian mechanics and an introduction to Lagrangian and Hamiltonian mechanics. Newtonian mechanics is, both historically and otherwise, the starting point of all of physics. The Lagrangian and Hamiltonian formulations of classical mechanics allow a more profound vision of the subject while also introducing the language in which much of higher -level theoretical physics is expressed.  Pre-requisites: MP1  Electricity & Magnetism in Light of Relativity (semester 3 ) The beautiful theory of electricity and magnetism is, with classical mechanics, the heart of c lassical physics. What is often not appreciated at the undergraduate level is that electricity and magnetism are related in a way that reveals the structure of space -time. In this course relativity will be used from the beginning to relate electric and mag netic fields, so that their unity, as components of the electromagnetic field are revealed and used in the study of Maxwell’s Equations.  Pre-requisites: MP1  Physics Lab 2 (semester 3) Designed to accompany the theory courses Classical Mechanics and Ele ctricity & Magnetism in Light of Relativity, this laboratory course explores their experimental foundations. Students will be introduced to video -analysis and modelling to study elastic and inelastic collisions, uniformly accelerated motion, and terminal v elocity. In addition, students will also be introduced to physical systems exhibiting electromagnetic damping, resonant electronics circuits, and two -dimensional electrostatics.  Pre-requisites: Physics Lab 1      7 Mathematical Physics 2 (semester 4 ) This mathematical physics course aims to be an introduction to differential equations. Besides standard topics in ordinary and partial differential equations, nonlinear dynamical systems will be studied and nonlinear ODEs will be analysed using geometric a nd computational tools. Fourier series will also be studied.  Pre-requisites: MP1  Thermal Physics (semester 4) An Integrated Approach to Thermodynamics and Kinetic Theory. There are three approaches to study systems with large numbers of atoms and molec ules, which exhibit properties like temperature and entropy: kinetic theory, classical thermodynamics, and statistical mechanics.

FAQs      20         2 Introduction Physics is a doorway to some of the most beautiful and profound phenomena in the universe like black holes, supernovae, Bose -Einstein condensates, superconductors. It is, simultaneously, a driver of lifestyle -changing technology, e.g., engines, electricity, and transistors; and a powerful way of perceiving and analyzing problems that can be applied in various domains, both within and outside standard physics. The beauty and profundity of the phenomena studied by physicists offer romance and excite passion, and the utility of its discoveries and th e power of its methods arouse interest.  These methods can be very intricate and demanding: theoretical physics requires a skilful combination of physical and mathematical thinking, and experimental physics requires in addition the ability to turn tentati ve ideas into physical devices that can put those ideas to the test. As a result, the successful practice of physics demands rigour, flexibility, mechanical adroitness, persistence, and great imagination. The physicist’s imagination is nourished not just b y physics but also by other areas of human enquiry and thought, of the kind that an Ashoka undergraduate is expected to encounter.  With all of this in mind, the physics programme has been designed to: (i) allow students wishing to major in physics to discov er real physics and make a wise choice, in the first year; (ii) provide, throughout, a thorough training in fundamental physics; (iii) bring together everything learnt earlier, and give students the option to pursue more advanced courses in physics or branch out into other areas, in the third year. The idea is to accompany those wishing to become professional physicists as they take the f irst steps in that direction, and to introduce everyone who goes through the programme to the physicist’s way of thinking.     3 Physics Major – Typical Trajectory Semester 2: Discovering UG -level Physics A student wishing to major, minor, or pursue a concentration in Physics is expected to take the introductory course in calculus (Calculus I) offered by the Mathematics Department. Students wishing to major in Physics should plan to take it in their first s emester.  Requirement for Physics major : 13 core physics courses + 2 electives (60 credits)  The physics -major sequence begins in semester 2, with two courses, one in theoretical physics and the other in experimental physics. The first purpose of these c ourses is to provide an experience of UG level physics on the basis of which a student can decide whether or not to major in physics, i.e., they are gateway courses. The second purpose of these courses is to serve as an introduction to the physicist’s way of thinking about problems and solving them, something that has proved useful not just to physicists but also to those in other disciplines that make use of quantitative methods and experiments, e.g., mathematics, computer science, economics, psychology, a nd biology.  Semester 3, 4 and 5: The Physics Core  The physics courses in these 3 semesters form the core of the physicist’s undergraduate canon. Anyone majoring in physics is expected to be thorough in these areas. Each semester has 2 -3 theory courses and an accompanying lab.  Semester 6: Exploring more advanced options  The student can opt for elective courses: each student majoring in physics is required to take at least two. From the student’s point of view, the electives chosen is likely to indicate a post -graduate direction – towards theoretical physics, towards experimental physics or perhaps away from physics into an allied discipline that would benefit from training in physics.        4 Physics Minor or Concentration  To Minor in physics a student must do six courses in physics (24 credits). Of these the two gateway courses – MP1 and Lab 1 – are compulsory. At least two more courses should be taken from among the core courses offered in semesters 3, 4, and 5, provided a ppropriate prerequisites have been satisfied for these courses (recommended courses: Classical Mechanics and Thermal Physics).  The remaining two may be either other compulsory or elective courses offered by the Physics Department or cross -listed with Phy sics, provided appropriate prerequisites have been satisfied. In place of one elective course, a student may take an Independent Study Module (ISM) of equivalent credit.  For a Concentration in physics a student must do six courses in physics (16 credits ). Of these the two gateway courses – MP1 and Lab 1 – are compulsory.  At least two more courses should be taken from among the core courses offered in semesters 3, 4, and 5, provided appropriate prerequisites have been satisfied for these courses (recomm ended courses: Classical Mechanics and Thermal Physics)          5 General Information on the Physics Courses Mathematical level — All theory courses are calculus -based. The level of mathematical sophistication will increase progressively. The mathematical - physics courses will be application -oriented rather than proof -oriented. Familiarity with +2 level physics and mathematics is a ssumed.  Labs — All lab courses will involve extensive use of instruments to make observations. These experiments will in general illustrate ideas studied in the accompanying theory courses.  The use of computers — Many theory courses will include computa tional exercises, generally using the programming language Python. Labs will also require the use of computers.  Duration — Theory courses: two lectures a week each lasting 1.5 hours. In addition, there may be a 1.5 -hour tutorial per week . Laboratory: one 3 -hour main lab session per week and one 3 -hour extra session per week for lab course.  List of Physics Courses Compulsory/Core Courses Mathematical Physics 1 (Gateway course: semester 2) This course aims to familiarise the student with a variety of mathematical techniques which every student of physics should be conversant with. Having taken the course, you should be comfortable with casting a wide variety of physics problems in mathematical language and being able to analyse and solve them subsequently.

For civil and congenial participation in the campus residence life experience, students are expected to familiarise themselves and abide by this policy. Any violation of this policy will result in a disciplinary infraction with a consequent course of action as decided by the appropriate University committee.      Room and Roommate Assignment A. Room Allocation At the beginning of the academic year, room allotment is made on a twin-sharing basis for the entire academic year as per the building-level assignments approved by the University. For emergency preparedness, the University needs to know the room assignment of each student living in campus housing. Students therefore may not change rooms or roommates without official authorisation. Note: Students who are not enrolled in any academic courses will not be allotted a room within the University housing. B. Disability related Accommodations Students are expected to self-identify any specific disability-related needs and raise their requests via email with the Office of Learning Support (OLS) at ols@ashoka.edu.in to avail housing accommodations prior to the start of the academic year. Incoming students may reach out to the Office of Admissions first while returning students (who have a newly-diagnosed condition or a change to a previously documented condition) can register directly with OLS. Students are required to provide comprehensive professional documentation of their disability to the Office of Learning Support. OLS will then assess and recommend housing accommodations (such as location, lights, washroom accessibility, ergonomic furniture etc.) to the Residence Life Office. The student must be willing to live in any Residence Hall and/or room that is determined to meet their disability/medical need by the University. All such accommodations will be made on a space-available basis and only for the concerned individual – not for a group. C. Room Reassignment Both occupants may request a room change for non-functioning room facilities or any other difficult room experience related to the infrastructure. In all such situations, the concerned students should meet with their respective Warden for appropriate assistance. Once the Warden confirms the validity of the request made, they may recommend a room change for the occupants in consultation with the senior member(s) of the Residence Life Office. If the room change request is approved, the Residence Life Office will make an offer regarding the feasible arrangement. After the offer is made, the student will have 24 hours to decline or accept the offer. If the offer is accepted, the students will have 48 hours to move into the newly assigned room and return the keys for the previous assignment. If the students do not respond to the offer within the stipulated duration of 24 hours, the offer will be withdrawn by the Residence Life Office. Reassignments for special circumstances, such as a recommendation from the Office of Learning Support (OLS), serious facility-related problems that can be a potential life hazard etc., will be given the highest priority. Important: Residence Life Office reserves the right to reassign any room if deemed necessary during the academic year. D. Resident Rights As a stressful living environment can affect a student’s academic performance and emotional well-being, Ashoka University is committed to ensuring that certain basic rights and duties are binding upon all students. These are – 1. The right to privacy 2. The right to free and uninhibited access to the allotted room at all times 3. The right to have the roommate and/or peers respect personal belongings 4. The right to study and sleep peacefully in the allotted room, free from any undue interference or hindrance from the roommate and/or peers 5. The right to be asked/consulted with and to grant/deny permission for having\\xa0 peers invited over in the allotted room 6. The right to a hygienic and clean living environment 7. The right to free and uninhibited access to common spaces at all times 8. The right to be treated as equal without fear of harassment, intimidation, bullying, and physical and/or emotional harm 9. The right to discuss and resolve disagreements or conflicts in a respectful, civil, and open manner Any violation of the above-stated rights can be reported to the concerned authorities for further action. E. Roommate Allocation Roommates are decided by the University with the help of relevant information provided by the students themselves through the Roommate Matching Form for incoming students. Returning students are allowed to choose their preferred roommates by indicating the same in the Roommate Preference Form shared by the Residence Life Office at the beginning of each academic year. All students are expected to room with students from within their own batch. Residential Access A. Keys Students will be issued keys to their allotted room including keys for the wardrobe and desk drawers at the beginning of the academic year. They will be responsible for keeping their keys safe as the University is not liable for losses/damages sustained to personal belongings because they lend their keys to another individual(s). Possession and/or misuse of keys belonging to other students is strictly prohibited and those found in violation will be liable for disciplinary action. Duplication of the keys and/or use of duplicate keys for unauthorised access is a punishable offense and will be reported to the concerned committee. If the key(s) is lost, a replacement key may be issued by the Residence Life Office subject to the availability of the concerned personnel. Any costs incurred for the replacement key will have to be borne by the student. Replacing, exchanging, or otherwise tampering with room/wardrobe door handles and locks is prohibited. If the lock is non-functional, it is expected that the student will reach out to the respective Warden for assistance. Students are required to entrust the Warden with any unattended keys that they chance upon anywhere on campus. Students are not allowed to leave their keys in their room or entrust their keys with their peers at the end of the academic year. They are expected to complete the check-out process, including returning the keys, themselves. B. ID Card Incoming students are issued University 6ID Cards (HID enabled) by the Residence Life Office during the check-in process. Possession and/or misuse of ID cards belonging to other students is strictly prohibited and those found in violation will be liable for disciplinary action. If the ID card is lost, the student should immediately alert the Residence Life Office so that the card can be deactivated to prevent any misuse. A replacement will be issued subject to processing time. The cost incurred for replacing the ID card will have to be borne by the student. Students are required to entrust the Warden with any unattended University ID cards that they chance upon anywhere on campus. Students must carry their University issued ID cards at all times and produce it on demand by the security staff or any other authorised personnel. Failure to produce the ID card on demand may be treated as an act of misconduct if satisfactory reasons are not provided upon further enquiry. During the Exit Clearance process from the University, due to withdrawal from/completion of their academic programme, the students must surrender their ID card back to the Residence Life Office. Residence Support The Residence Life Office is managed through the efforts of a robust team of staff. The descriptions of their position are as below: The Residence Life Office is led and overseen by the Associate Director who is responsible for maintaining discipline alongside, providing pastoral care and support within the Halls of Residence. The efforts of the Associate Director are supported by the dynamic programme and executive teams. The programme team comprises of the Assistant Director and Assistants. The executive tea consists of the Wardens and Assistant Wardens. Together, they are all responsible for providing an inclusive, safe, positive, and comfortable residential experience to students. Each residential building is staffed by at least one executive team member from the Residence Life Office. Their primary role is to manage the student check-in and check-out process, respond to emergencies and disciplinar infractions, manage building infrastructure, coordinate in-hall housekeeping and maintenance staff, and conduct business necessary to the well-being of the student community. Concerns about Residence Life policies, sources of conflict in the hall, conduct, infractions or building infrastructure should be reported first to the Warden, before reaching out to the Associate Director.      Common Area Conduct Residence Hall balconies must be kept clean and neat at all times. Events and/or group activities are not permitted on Hall balconies without the written approval of the Residence Life Office. Please limit the number of people in such spaces and exercise extreme caution. Please keep washrooms clean after use and if found choked or unclean due to negligence or deliberate action repeatedly, the Housekeeping staff will not be expected to clean these areas and the students on that floor will have to take the responsibility to get it cleaned. The common rooms shall be open to students at all times subject to maintenance schedule and space bookings. The University is not responsible for money lost in vending machines. Students are strictly prohibited from monopolising the common areas. Sleeping in the common rooms and shifting furniture or removing it from a designated area to change the interiors of the common rooms fundamentally is not permitted. Playing games in the hallway, obstructing high-traffic areas (such as doorways, hallways, stairwells) directly and/or through decorations/displays, and all forms of vandalism including but not limited to tampering with emergency signage/response materials (fire extinguishing facilities, exit signs) is strictly prohibited. Upon any damage or loss to University property in common areas including but not limited to the lounge, floors, corridors, washrooms and reading rooms, costs incurred for the purposes of repair or replacement will be billed to the student(s) found responsible. Advertising and publicity materials (i.e. fliers, posters and banners) can be posted only on bulletin boards and only by members of the Ashoka community. All fliers/posters must clearly identify the name of the individual or organization responsible for the content. They should be limited to one per bulletin board and must not block windows, doorways, or walkways. The individual who posted the materials is responsible for removing any fliers/posters after the event or opportunity being advertised has ended. No one should cover or remove another’s flier, poster or banner. Blackboard/Spray chalking is strictly prohibited on walls of Residences Halls as well as all fixtures and will incur a cleaning fee. Access to non-residential spaces (e.g. attics, mechanical rooms, equipment rooms, roofs) is restricted to authorized university personnel. Quiet Hours In an effort to encourage a comfortable studying and resting environment for all students, Quiet Hours on the entire campus, including the Residence Halls, are to be observed between 01:00 am to 07:00 am every day. During Quiet Hours, students are expected to refrain from playing music or creating loud noise in the Residence Hall rooms, washrooms, hallways etc. Even at all other 7times, students are expected to not cause 8disturbance to other members of the Ashoka community. Construction, renovation, and repair projects (both on and off campus) will necessarily cause increased noise around directly involved and nearby Residence Halls. While all possible measures are taken to minimise the impact of these projects, any student moving into or living in affected areas should be prepared to accept the unavoidable aspects of life on campus under construction and post-construction. Students moving out of the University campus to adjoining village areas and institutions must ensure that they do not create any disturbance that will inconvenience the residents of the neighbourhood. Policies and Regulations Residence Life is governed by various rules and regulations to ensure seamless functioning and harmonious and healthy living conditions for one and all. Listed below is a brief outline of these rules and regulations: Ashoka University Campus – including the Residence Halls – is an alcohol-free, smoke-free and drug-free campus, governed by national, state and university laws and regulations for the same. The University does not permit both check-in and check-out from the campus between the hours of 12:00 AM (midnight) to 6:00 AM. This means that no student is allowed to enter/exit campus after 12:00 AM (midnight) and no student is allowed to enter/exit campus before 6:00 AM. Off-campus visitors will not have access to the Residence Halls. They are allowed to visit students on campus between 8:00 am and 108:00 pm. Parents/Guardians will be permitted to access their ward’s room during moving-in at the time of Orientation and moving out at the end of the academic programme (and on occasions of medical emergencies, with prior knowledge and approval of the respective Warden.) Off-campus students are expected to carry their University ID Card with them and sign in at the front desk to gain admittance inside the Residence Halls. They will not have access to the resident rooms but may meet with their peers in the Common Room of the Residence Hall. The movement of students visiting Residence Hall rooms is allowed both ways across men’s and women’s Residence Halls between 8:00 am and 12:30 am. The students must sign in and sign out manually through registers maintained at the entrance of all Residences Halls. However, the rights of the roommate supersede the privilege of visitation i.e. visitation is a privilege that is subordinate to the resident’s rights such as the right to privacy and the right to free and uninhibited access to the room. Therefore, a resident’s request for any guest to leave their room must be honoured, irrespective of the visitation hours and regardless of the sex or gender of the guest. Misuse, duplication, and/or lending of your keys and ID Card is prohibited. Students will be personally responsible for the maintenance of their rooms, furniture, bathrooms and University property in their use. The University does not take responsibility for the personal belongings of students on or off campus. Students are prohibited from having private vehicles, pets, weapons and weapons-grade material within campus premises. Note: Kindly refer to the Residence Life Policies available on the portal for more details.      The Residence Life Programme at Ashoka University comprises of a wide variety of vibrant social, educational, recreational and cultural programmes that are run and led by the Residence Life Staff and students. These Residence Life Programmes are centered around the core values and principles of civic responsibility, citizenship, empathy, respect, diversity, inclusion, self-care, health, and wellness. The focus of these programmes is to help foster a sense of community among residents giving them ample opportunities to meet, interact, bond and have fun together.   Resident Assistants (RAs) are paraprofessionals who live on a floor with 40-70 residents, managing critical administrative tasks as well as the primary responsibility of responding to the personal needs of these residents. Their unique positions, as quasi-staff members within the Residence Halls, allow them to act as a force for positive change in the lives of the students with whom they interact. The RA Programme aims to create an inclusive living environment in the Halls of Residence and works towards fostering an environment that embraces diversity and actively values the dignity and self-worth of all members of the community. This is done by the RAs through various active community programming efforts on the floor and across the Residence Halls, regular one-on-one office hours, periodic floor meetings etc. The RAs also plan and host a plethora of social and educational activities for residents thus, enabling a positive living environment in the Residence Halls. These range from events addressing issues of gender & sexuality and self-care to floor cook-offs and game nights to name a few. The Resident Assistant Coordinators (RACs) along with the RA Mentors supervise and manage the RA Programme. The RACs work in tandem with the Dean (Office of Student Affairs) and the Associate Director (Residence Life Office) to develop the RA Programme as a whole. The RACs also serve as mentors to students, and are available during selected business hours to discuss concerns related to Residence as well as Campus Life. Follow us on Instagram :      Dorm Olympics is one of the biggest and most sought-after events organised in the Residence Halls. It began in 2016 with the hope of building the feeling of togetherness and community in a fully residential campus. The fifth edition of the Dorm Olympics, held virtually in February of 2021, was a huge success with the participation of over 300 Ashokans. The event saw participation from all constituencies of the University including students, administration and support staff. Some of the competitive events organised as part of Dorm Olympics include Donuts in a String, Cow Drop, Pani Puri Eating Competition, Dizzy Penalties. To know more, follow us on Instagram : \\xa0      Coffee and More…! aims to create a private, safe space for conversations where students can freely engage with issues and challenges, they face in their everyday lives. These conversations cover a wide range of subjects such as fitness and nutrition, life after college, safety on substance, sleep problems, safe sex practices, reproductive health, bullying, everyday sexism, sexual harassment and much more. By inviting faculty, staff and experts, the series aims to demystify and destigmatize these subjects, allowing for open, free-flowing conversations. Their aim is twofold- one of creating opportunities for an empathetic listening and awareness; other enabling students in dealing with real life challenges and situations towards making an informed choice.      The Great Ashokan Weekend was initiated with the purpose of facilitating student interaction with staff and faculty in a fun and informal setting. Each event of the great Ashokan Weekend is designed as a walk-through of the campus moving between key landmarks on the premises. Despite being held online, the event saw active participation from faculty, staff and students in 2020. Some of the events organised as part of the Great Ashokan Weekend were Pitch Please, Ashoka Family Feud, Fantasy Mess Menu, Pajama Dance Dazel.

The chemistry major must complete a total 14 courses to get a graduate degree from Ashoka University. This includes 7 core theory courses and 4 lab courses and any 3 electives. Courses offered by chemistry department or cross -listed with the chemistry department (if any) will also be counted. T he final year students will be offered proposal writing course and can pursue independent research in the department.  The core (theory) courses are:  • Energetics of Change (Semester II) • Basic Inorganic Chemistry (Semester III)  • Concepts in Organic Chemistry (Semester III)  • Atoms, quanta and light (Semester III)  • Inorganic Chemistry (Semester IV)  • Rate, order and mechanism (Semester IV)  • Mechanistic Organic Chemistry (Semester V) • Modern Methods of Analysis and Characterization (Semester V) • Organic Synthesis: Reagents and Synthetic Strategies (Semester VI)  Electives  Electives courses are there to broaden the knowledge of the core courses so that students c an have better understanding of the subjects. There are many courses Ashoka chemistry is offering. A major in chemistry must choose at least 3 electives to graduate.  Suggested Electives • Applied Organometallic & Coordination Chemistry • Environmental Analysis • Chemical Biology • Chemistry of Materials • Renewable Energy: Hydrogen and Solar Energy • Materials at nano scale • Computational Chemistry and Molecular Simulation • Environmental Chemist ry • Energy Materials: Batteries, Super capacitors etc  The undergraduate Minor in Chemistry  Students from different department are always encouraged to take chemistry as their minor. The knowledge will help a student to understand the science in our everyday life. This will also help to become a better researcher in any field of science. We believe it’s a great opportunity for a liberal university student.  To pursue minor in Chemistry at Ashoka, student must take 6 courses. This can include direct course offered from chemistry department or cross -listed (if any) with the department. 4 theory courses and a ny 2 electives can be chosen to complete a minor in Chemistry. Lab courses can be also considered as a minor subject.  Concentration in Chemistry  For taking concentration in Chemistry student must take minimum 4 courses and any 1 elective. In this case also lab course will be considered as a concentration subject.   Prerequisite  The professors require a minimum knowledge of a student for a course . It will be always mentioned in the webpage of chemistry about the prerequisite or students can directly ask the professors. For any introductory theory or lab course and any basic chemistry course no prerequisite requires. For example, ‘introductory labo ratory course’ (1401 -1) demands no prerequisite. For 1000/2000 level courses like ‘Chemistry for life’ no prerequisite needed, anybody can participate. Students from Physics, Biology and Environmental Science can take physical chemistry / theoretical chemis try, chemical biology and environmental chemistry course after discussing with the respective professors without any prerequisite .

The students majoring in Chemistry as well as those who are interested or doing minor, both will get benefit from this course. Meticulous understanding of chemistry for any students is the focus of th is syllabus.  Chemistry is involved in everything we do. Even if y ou are not chemist, every time you cook, bake, use the washing powder, toothpaste or taking medicine, you are dealing with chemicals . The study of Chemist ry provides a molecular level of description as well as insights into chemical bonding and give you a perfect picture of bond breaking and forming, overall a reaction. At Ashoka, our objective is to teach Chemistry in an integrative and holistic manner connecting with other branches of science, physics, biology, computer and environmental science . We are constantly trying to correlate with them and bring out the best int erest of our students. We are very hopeful to be an integrated part of Ashoka University in near future.  Further, the chemistry department is building up to do innovative and current research. This semester we have no lab course officially, but students interested to do any chemical reaction studying in theory class are always welcome and perform under the monitoring of professor s. The chemistry research requires to have a very sound knowledge on the basic of chemistry and our target is to build you up as an aspiring researcher through the basic concept of organic, inorganic and physical chemistry in this semester.

      "{'page_content': '19 FACULTY POLICIES I MARCH 2018IPR Policy 1. Preamble: a. Intellectual Property (IP) is new and creative work resulting from research, innovation and teaching in any discipline including, but not limited to, natural sciences, social sciences, humanities, performing arts, engineering, etc. b. Such IP includes, for instance, (a) process to synthesize a new material, (b) new design of a product or service, (c) an algorithm, software, or an “app” to achieve a certain computational, communication or control function, as also (d) teaching and learning resources and (e) academic books and published articles. c. Documentation of IP may take the form of a research article, book, thesis, project report, drawing, lecture notes, lab notes, documentary film, etc. d. Protection of IP will, however, take the form of a copyright, patent or trademark registration depending upon the IP . In particular, research articles, books, theses, drawings, lecture notes, lab notes, documentary film are copyrighted, while (new) inventions, designs, algorithms, etc. are patented. e. Ashoka University is a research-driven university, it expects its faculty and students to spend significant fraction of its time engaged in research and innovation, while disseminating research outcome in the form of publications of journal articles, books, or conference presentations. f. Even as Ashoka University aims to offer world-class modern undergraduate and post-graduate programmes, its curricula, pedagogy and teaching and learning materials are expected to be creative and uniquely different. g. It is expected that in time to come significant IP will be generated by the university’s faculty and students. It is, therefore, important for the university to protect rights to all such IP so that interests of the faculty, students and 20 ASHOKA UNIVERSITYthe university are adequately protected. This document on university policy on IP rights is in response to that need. 2. About this document: a. This document identifies all issues that concern generation of IP by the faculty, staff and students of Ashoka University, protection of IP in the form of patent, copyright, trademark, etc., and the licensing of its IP rights to third parties for commercialization. b. This document is subject to the IPR laws of India, such as Trade and Merchandise Marks Act,1958, Patent Act, 1970, Copy Rights Act, 1957 and Designs Act, 2000 etc. and their amendments. c. In doing so, this document outlines the university’s policy towards: i. Publication of research outcomes in journals or at conferences or in the form of books, ii. Establishing ownership of IP created by its faculty, staff and students, or co-ownership in case research is sponsored by a third party or research is conducted in collaboration with researchers from another organization, iii. Licensing of, or transfer of, IP rights to third parties for commercialization and consequent sharing of revenue with co-inventors, iv. Dissemination and enforcement of IPR policy, including its reflection in employment contracts, in agreements concerning research grants or collaboration with other organization, or in contracts with vendors supplying goods and services to the university, v. Academic recognition to faculty towards promotions or tenure decisions for generation of IP in the form of a patent, etc. vi. Establishing a university-wide committee to manage all aspects of IP , including generation, protection and licensing of IP , together with budgetary and administrative support needed therefore. The document should be periodically reviewed, and changes made depending upon need and experience gained.21 FACULTY POLICIES I MARCH 20183. Definitions: In this document the following definitions shall apply, a. “The University” means Ashoka University. b. “Member” means full-time faculty (including tenured faculty, faculty on tenure-track, “visiting faculty”, & “faculty on-contract”) and full-time staff employed by the University. It also includes students enrolled on a full-time basis in an undergraduate (UG), post-graduate (PG), or doctoral (PhD) or post-doctoral fellowship (PDF) programme. Part-time faculty, Guest faculty, Adjunct faculty or students enrolled in any UG/PG/PhD program on a part-time basis are also considered “members” but only to the extent of their engagement with the university, and not outside. c. “IP generated” means IP generated by a member during the member’s tenure/engagement with the University. d. “IP rights” means ownership of IP , together with identification of list of members who have contributed to creation of such IP . e. “Tenure” means to the actual period of employment or studentship. f. “Cooling period” means to the one year period immediately following termination of employment/studentship of the member. g. “Infrastructure facilities” means physical infrastructure such as laboratories, lecture rooms, IT resources (including computer and storage servers, specialized software), and other services provided by university (such as HR, Finance & Accounts). Infrastructure facilities will exclude use of the Library, access to Internet and email services and other facilities such as on-campus housing, gymnasium. h. “Employee’s obligations to the University” means work carried out by a member as part of deliverables expected of him/her as part of employment or studies. This includes research, teaching, administration, or service to the university. i. “Sponsor” means an organization that commits itself to 22 ASHOKA UNIVERSITYproviding funds, equipment, etc. for a defined, time-bound activity at the university such as basic/applied research, consulting assignment, training programme, etc. 4. Applicability of IPR Policy: a. This policy on IP rights (IPR) will apply to full-time members of the university (and this includes faculty, staff and students). b. This policy on IPR will also apply to all part-time “Guest” or “ Adjunct” faculty or part-time students, but only to the extent of their engagement with the university. c. This IPR policy will also have a bearing on an agreement that the university signs with a sponsoring organization, collaborating organization or with a vendor. 5. Ownership of IP: a. Published Materials i. The university recognizes that globally faculty and students prefer to publish their research outcomes or creative works in the form of journal articles, papers presented in conferences, newspaper articles, or as books. They do so in order to ensure that the research outcome is disseminated globally, and in the shortest possible time. ii. As a consequence, the university encourages its members to publish their findings in journals, conferences, newspaper articles, or as books, etc. even as the university recognizes that relevant publishers will own copyright to such works. In all such cases, the University will not seek to own rights to such IP . iii. However, members should understand that publication in a journal or at a conference, or as a book may jeopardize any effort later to file a patent application. b. Creative Common License i. The university also recognizes that globally faculty and students sometimes prefer to place their creative works under one of the ‘creative commons licenses that allows members to retain copyright while allowing others to 23 FACULTY POLICIES I MARCH 2018copy, distribute, and use their work. They do so with a view to contribute to growing and collective wealth of knowledge for everyone to freely use. ii. As a consequence, the university encourages its members to share their creative works under creative commons licenses, while retaining copyright to the IP . In particular, the University will not seek to own rights to such IP . iii. Here again, members should understand that placing their creative works in Creative Commons may jeopardize any effort later to file a patent application. c. Thesis /Dissertation i. As is the practice in universities elsewhere, the copyright to thesis/dissertation will be owned by the student. ii. Note, however, copyright pertains only to thesis document itself (or equivalently to the form in which the research findings or creative work are documented), whereas ownership of invention/development described in the thesis will be governed by IPR policy statements made elsewhere in this policy document. d. Other Creative Works i. The university recognizes that there are forms of creative works for which the copyright will either vest with the creator(s) or with the organization that publishes them. Consequently, the University will not seek ownership to such works. Such creative works include, but is not limited to, blogs, newspaper articles, films, documentaries, music compositions, teaching and learning materials, etc. ii. Unless otherwise agreed to, under the conditions listed above, the University will seek assignment of copyright to such creative works if it is specifically commissioned by the University by way of funds, ideas, etc. e. IP Generated by Faculty or students; i. The university will seek to own, and thus protect, all IP generated by its faculty or students as part of their obligations to the University. This is, however, subject to certain conditions set forth below.24 ASHOKA UNIVERSITYii. The university will not seek to own, nor protect, any IP generated by its members which is (a) unrelated to their obligations to the university, and does not use university’s infrastructure. IP generated from a project funded by a sponsor will be owned by the university if significant infrastructure facilities of the university are used. However, depending upon the level of funding and research contribution by sponsor, co-ownership of IP may be negotiated by the university and incorporated into an agreement before the project is started. f. IP Generated out of Research Collaboration i. Ownership of IP generated as a result of research collaboration with researchers from another organization that is not funding the research will be decided mutually anytime during course of collaboration. g. IP Generated from Consulting Assignment: i. IP generated from a consulting assignment awarded to a member by a sponsor will generally be owned by the sponsor. ii. However, if significant resource(s) of the university are used, or if the assignment is only partly funded by sponsor, the university will negotiate with the sponsor co-ownership of IP so generated. h. Academic and Teaching Programmes: i. For every academic (or teaching) programme offered, the university will own the IP concerning its curriculum (viz. description of admission & graduation requirements, programme structure, pre-requisites, description of individual courses together with associated credits, standardized lab experiments together with lab manual, pedagogy, etc.). ii. However, copyright to all teaching/learning resources developed by member(s) shall vest with the member(s). This includes lecture notes or slides, tests, quizzes, home assignments, learning materials, etc.25 FACULTY POLICIES I MARCH 2018i. IP Generated by start-ups: i. IP generated by start-ups that are part of University’s incubation programme shall be owned by the start-up. ii. This will remain so even though members are engaged with a start-up company on a part-time basis or full-time basis on leave from the university (this is also covered by policy statement concerning IP generated during a member’s visit to another organization on leave from the university). j. IP Generated by Contractors, Consultants and Vendors i. All IP generated by contractors, consultants or vendors as part of their engagement with the University will be owned by the University, unless agreed to otherwise as part of the contract. k. Access to IP owned by the University i. As a matter of IPR policy the University allows its members free access to all IP that it owns (or co-owns with another organization) and its use for purpose of teaching and continued research at the university. l. IP generated by members while visiting another Organisation: i. Any IP generated by any of its members while visiting another organization on leave from the university will be subject to the IPR policy of that organization. ii. However, if the IP so generated has its origin while working at the University prior to the visit, the University and the organization may enter into an agreement to co-own IP or assign IP to either organization. 6. Protecting IP Rights: a. Every time an inventor (or group of co-inventors) identify and propose that a certain research outcome be protected by the University, the University will follow a defined process to determine whether it will seek protection of the proposed IP in the form of a patent (or copyright, or trade mark or design).26 ASHOKA UNIVERSITYb. If the university decides to proceed with protection of IP , the university shall put in the requisite time, effort and funds and seek protection of IP within India and/or in other regions. c. The concerned member(s) will, on their part, provide all technical details including consent necessary to file an application for obtaining rights on such IP . d. Once granted, the university will set aside funds for subsequent maintenance of patents or copyrights. e. However, in case where the university decides to not proceed with protection of IP , the member(s) may proceed to protect the IP by filing for patent or copyright registration at their own cost, and claim ownership to the IP . f. In such cases the university will seek the right for its members to use the IP for purpose of teaching and continued research at the university. 7. Academic recognition for generation of IP: a. The University will evolve a mechanism to grant academic recognition at the time of promotions and tenure decisions for contribution made by faculty members once a patent has been granted, or applied for, in India or abroad. b. It is to be understood that the said recognition will be greater in case the IP is licensed to, or transferred outright, to a third part for commercialization. 8. Grant of licensing IP for commercialization: a. The university will evolve processes, together with terms for one-time (or periodic) royalty payments, by which it grants license, or outright transfer, to a third party for commercialization of IP that it solely owns, or co-owns with a collaborator. b. In case of any IP it co-owns with a collaborator (or sponsor), the university will engage with the collaborator before granting license to a third party for commercialization of IP . c. In some cases the third party referred to may be the collaborator with which the university co-owns the IP .27 FACULTY POLICIES I MARCH 2018d. The university will be liberal in granting license to a start- up if one of the inventors of IP is a promoter of the start-up. e. Even in cases where IP is licensed or transferred to a third party, the university will seek to retain the right to use the IP for purpose of teaching and continued research at the university. f. The university will evolve a formula for sharing with inventors a part of the royalty payments it receives as a result of licensing the IP or for its outright transfer, which will form part of the consultancy policy document. 9. Monitoring and responding to infringement of IPR: a. In case of any IP the University owns, or co-owns with a collaborator, the university will evolve mechanisms to monitor infringement of IPR by another organization, and suitably respond to any infringement. Towards this the University will evolve a mechanism to monitor and respond suitably. b. In case of IP it co-owns with a collaborator: i. The university will monitor and respond in case a collaborator infringes on the university’s rights in violation of the IPR sharing agreement with the collaborator. ii. The university will make every effort to ensure that its own faculty and students do not infringe upon IP rights co-owned with collaborators, or IP that is solely owned by third parties. 10.

Ideally, your webcam is pointed to a wall where there is little possibility of something happening in the background. If this is not possible, y ou can recreate this effect by hanging up a plain, thick white bedsheet. Limiting the space behind you will also help with the lighting auto-brightness. Find a comfortable seat and position You will be sitting for a long time, especially for multiple classes per day. It can be hard to concrete on teaching if you are uncomfortable. Get in a comfortable position first, and then set up the lighting, webcam and audio to accommodate you. Set up proper lighting Webcams can be remarkably unflattering, and a big part of appearing properly on camera is setting up the right lighting. Lighting from the back will darken your face. Lighting from only overhead lights tends to make you appear spectral. Inconsistent lighting, such as from a window, will cause the auto-brightness on your webcam to fluctuate. Soft, indirect lighting from the front, as depicted in the image on the right, works best. If lighting is a problem, ring-lights are relatively inexpensive and can go a long way in creating a better image. Adjust Webcam Height Having the webcam at an odd angle can distort how you can come across on video. Place the camera at eye level at eye level or slightly higher. Avoid angling the camera up from below your eye level. Place the camera far enough away that you can frame yourself in the middle of the image. If you were to split up the screen into thirds, your eyes should intersect with or be slightly below the line for the top third. See the figures below for an example. Figure 1 : Ideal lighting for a webcam session. Soft, indirect lighting from the front w orks best. Source: 5Setting Up Proper Acoustics Virtual meeting software like Google Meet and Zoom have integrated features that help eliminate background noise and eliminate volume levels. These features are not perfect, and you can do a lot to help the acoustics of your call. The microphone will pick up sounds in the background that can cause distortion in the feed. Eliminating this as much as possible will help keep the audio clear. Depending on your particular situation, having multiple auditory focal points will amplify some noises and reduce your own voice. The sound of a fan or air conditioner running can cause consistent background noise. Using headphones with an integrated microphone, can considerably improve the audio quality for you and your students. Figure 2 : The webcam should be at eye level or slightly higher. Source: Figure 3 : Your face should take up roughly the middle third of the frame. Source: https://www.labortools.com/hubfs/FramingThirds.jpg 6Remote Meeting Norms General ●All participants are encouraged to resolve technical issues before the meeting. Everyone should make sure that they have checked the video, microphone, and audio before joining the session. When possible, have a trial session with the technology before the first formal session. ●Be on time. Like an in-person meeting, showing up late can be distracting. Login to the meeting several minutes before it starts, in order to make sure you are there from the beginning. ●Please mute your microphone when you are not speaking. This keeps the background noise levels to a minimum, and helps every listener have a good experience. ➢Tip: To quickly mute your microphone use the keyboard shortcut: Google Meet  Zoom Windows Ctrl + d Alt + a Mac Cmd + d  Alt + a ●You are encouraged to keep your video turned on. It is hard for speakers to address someone they cannot see, and having a visual response from the audience makes speaking in a virtual meeting easier for everyone. If you are having bandwidth issues, turning off the video will help. ●Remote learning emulates a classroom as much as possible. This is best achieved when all participants are present, focused, and contribute as if they were in an in- class meeting. ●Please remember that the chat is a group chat. Whatever you type in there will be visible to the instructor, as well as everyone else in the meeting. Note that making comments not directly related to the course content is distracting to other students. Asking questions Each instructor will establish a protocol for asking questions. Some of these include: ●Raising your hand ● Using a “reaction” button in meeting ●Writing in the chat box Whatever the operational protocol, it is best for participants to wait until there is an acknowledgement by the instructor. Virtual meetings can be hard to follow when multiple people are speaking, and it is most efficient to contribute on a turn-based system. Other There is always a chance the technology fails or there is another issue with online instruction. Since time for the virtual meeting is very limited, it is best to address any issues outside of these hours 7Virtual Meeting Software In the summer of 2020, Ashoka decided to standardize its remote learning offerings. Currently, there is robust support for Google Classroom and its virtual meeting software Google Meet. For most use cases, Google Meet suits the requirements for a virtual class session. There are a limited number of Zoom licenses available to faculty who prefer to conduct their classes over Zoom. Faculty are encouraged to use these pieces of software because there will be a substantial institutional knowledge base regarding their feature set and useability. Attendance Attendance is both simple and challenging to manage in a virtual classroom. There is software available to automatically document attendance, but it is harder to determine who is actually physically present and paying attention during the session. It is a given that various technical problems could arise. The chrome extension “Meet Attendance” lets you take attendance during a live Google meet session. Closed Captioning and Transcription Google Meet allows any user in the session to turn on Closed Captioning for better intelligibility of the session. These captions are saved in the recording session, but not as a separate text file. If you would like to offer students the text transcript of the session this can be done through the Google Chrome extension: taqtic.io It is a good practice to save the transcript of your sessions for extra accessibility for students who were not able to attend the session. Recording Sessions Recording class sessions so they are available to students who were not able to attend is highly recommended. However, there may be scenarios where recording class sessions is not desirable. For example, if the course discusses personally sensitive topics recording it might stifle conversation. The default is that students assume they are being recorded. If the session is not being recorded it might be useful to let them know in advance. Recording Storage and Security In synchronous sessions, if you record your live lectures using Google Meet then they are available in the “Meeting folder” i n your Google drive. You can share these videos under the “classwork” tab in Classroom. Any textual, auditory or visual material in which students are identifiable may not be shared outside of the classroom without the express permission of the students depicted. Likewise, students may not distribute classroom recordings to any third parties. 9Making courses accessible for students with disabilities and English Language Learner issues benefits all students. In this respect, accessible course design offers a good set of design principles for course design more generally, and is often included under the larger umbrella of universal design for learning because it considers all possible users. Making course material accessible Planning for accessibility doesn’t automatically mean creating multiple versions or discarding activities, assignments, content up-front because it could be inaccessible for certain students. It means having thought through what you would do if a student for whom that activity was inaccessible registered for your class.2 The OLS recommends that the reading material be distributed in an accessible format such as Word or a Searchable PDF. Generally, accessible documents are first produced in Word, converted to PDF and then checked for accessibility . You may also refer to the more detailed presentation: Building Accessibility into Online Teaching and Learning . Making online lectures accessible Provide access to the lectures, synchronous or asynchronous, by using both the modalities –audio and visual. Invest in the technology that integrates both. Audio to Visual During lectures, the speech (audio) needs to be made available as a text to integrate the visual modality. Use technology tools that provide: ●Closed Captioning/ Subtitles ●Post-Production (recording) Transcription ●Live Transcription Google Meet has built-in Closed Captioning software. Tactiq.io creates free transcripts of these files and saves them in your Google Drive. ➢See: https://tactiq.io For free/paid Live Transcription in Zoom classes ➢See: Otter.ai Live Notes for Zoom Visual to Audio During lectures, the visuals, text and images, need to be made available as speech to integrate the audio modality. During the lecture, the text and images can be read aloud or explained and also shared with the students (with blindness) before class so that they can access them with their screen reader. Students with disabilities and English Language Learners have access to assistive technology resources on their own devices for the same. Contact Office of Learning Support at ols@ashoka.edu.in for further details. 2 https://canvas.ucdavis.edu/courses/34528/pages/accessibility- for-online-courses 10Teaching Modalities: Synchronous vs. Asynchronous Learning3 There are two options for instructors to facilitate class sessions remotely: ● Synchronous : instructors and students gather at the same time and interact in “real time” with a very short or “near -real time” exchange between instructors and students. ● Asynchronous: instructors prepare course materials for students in advance of students’ access. Students may access the course materials at a time of their choosing. Instructors may choose to engage their students synchronously or asynchronously depending on the course content or material that needs to be taught. There are distinct advantages and disadvantages to asynchronous and synchronous teaching options. Synchronous Teaching Asynchronous Teaching Advantages ❏Immediate personal engagement between students and instructors, which may create greate r feelings of community and reduce feelings of isolation. ❏More responsive exchanges between students and instructors, which may prevent miscommunication or misunderstanding.❏More scheduling flexibility, which may simultaneously make the learning experience s more accessible to different students. ❏Creates an archive of past materials that can be redeployed in future iterations of the course. ❏Students can control the pace of learning to a speed that is appropriate to them. Disadvanta ges ❏More challenging to schedule shared times for all students and instructors. ❏Some students may not be fully comfortable using the technology, or be disadvantaged by the limitations of their digital affordances.❏Students may feel less personally invested, and less satisfied wi thout the social interaction between their peers and instructors. ❏Course material may be misunderstood or have the potential to be misconstrued without the real -time interaction. 3 Teaching and Learning Center. “Faculty Resources for Remote Teaching and Learning.” Rider University.

Generally, smaller classes tend to lend themselves to synchronous activities, while larger classes might be more manageable with asynchro nous modalities. What constitutes a “small,” “medium,” or “large,” classroom is to some extent framed by the limits of the technology.4 The chart below provides a guide to possible activities based on classroom size. Though these will necessarily vary by discipline and specific course material. Type Participants User Experience Classroom Activity Small Participants < 25 Depending on device screen size and resolution, it is generally possible to see all participants in a Meet session simultaneously on one screen. Synchronous ❏Small breakout session with Zoom “rooms” ❏Guided discussion using Share Screen or shared document ❏Moderated chat discussion ❏Snap polls ❏Interactive Whiteboard Medium 25 < Participants < 50 It is not possible to see all participants simultaneously, or only with a dual monitor setup. Faculty will have to actively look at who may be participating in the class. Synchronous ❏Medium breakout sessions with Zoom “rooms” ❏Moderated chat discussion ❏Snap polls Asynchron ous ❏Pre-recorded materials by students ❏Short pre -recorded videos by the instructor Large 50 < Participants Google Meet allows for 250 participants and Zoom can handle 100, Synchronous ❏Snap polls ❏Interactive quizzes 4 The upper limits for the number of participants in Google Meet is 250 and Zoom is 100. 14but the ma jority will not be visible throughout the session. The current cap on the gallery size in Google Meet is 16. The Chrome extension Grid View , increases the number of visible participants to 100. Asynchronous ❏Pre-recorded lectures ❏Discussion board ❏Integrated quizzes ❏Annotated slides ❏Links to external sources Synchronous Pedagogies Overview Due to some of the technical limitations of online sessions, synchronous sessions tend to work best with smaller classes. With some modification, many of these pedagogies could equally well be applied to larger classes. Small Classrooms (Participants < 25) Small Breakout Sessions In Zoom it is possible to split the online class into “rooms.” Zoom has the option to do this automatically through randomization, or by manually allocating specific students into specific groups. Once c reated, it is possible for the instructor to “float” between rooms and check in on the discussion. This model allows faculty to check in with students on a more personal basis. ➢See: Zoom Managing Video Breakout Rooms . ➢Google Meet does not have this capability yet, but there are multiple plug- ins. One workaround can be found here , but it requires some planning and cannot be done “on the fly.” Guided discussion using Share Screen or shared document Provide readings for a class beforehand, assign one or two students as lead discussants for the paper/reading. The leads are meant to lead the discussion on the reading, possibly by preparing a minimal set of slides, if that works for the course/material. The instructor can then supplement the presentation at key points, and engage the rest of the class by asking pertinent questions. ➢See: Zoom Share Screen Google Meet Share Screen ➢ Moderated discussion using chat Not every student may be able to participate in a virtual classroom setting due to either technological or dispositional factors. In such cases, it is still possible for them to participate through the chat features of both Zoom and Google Meet. 15❏Possibility 1: Instructor posts question in the chat or shares it on the screen. Students respond to the question in their chat box, and this prompts further discussion. ❏Possibility 2: Instructor designates one student to moderate the discussion. Students who cannot actively participate in the video chat can still listen and respond and interact through the chat. ➢See: Zoom In-Meeting Chat   Google Meet In-Meeting Chat Discussion based on snap polls Snap polls are a quick way to gauge students’ surface -level understanding of a core concept. Ranging from true/false to multip le-choice, questions can be deployed directly during a Zoom session. A discrepancy in answers can solicit a point of clarification. ➢ See Pollings for Meetings Google Meet does not have native polling abilities, but there are various add-ons that achieve a similar effect. ➢See: Polls for Google Hangouts Chat Other options: ➢See: Poll Everywhere Polls Interactive Whiteboards Interactive whiteboards allow students to post into one collective space in real time. There are multiple ways of doing this, but the basic point is that students can brainstorm ideas and suggestions. Name Website Tool Cost Features Wakelet www.wakelet.com Allows students to share materials to a board in real time Basic is free Google Docs/Shee ts/Slides https://www.google.c om/docs/about/ Lets students collaborate in real time on a shared document Free Can see who does what on collaborative projects, never lose work (auto saves and can see ear lier drafts), can hyperlink all needed resources on one set of slides/document One of the challenges with interactive whiteboards is that the standard input device for a computer is a mouse or trackpad. These are very difficult to work with for any length of time. For more sustained usage of an interactive whiteboard there are a number of devices available. 16Recommended: ●WACOM One by CTL-672/K0-CX Medium 8.5-inch x 5.3-inch Graphic Tablet ●A stylus and pad input device that works with multiple pieces of software. Price around ₹8,000 ●IT is currently looking into requisitioning some devices for special cases. Please check to see if they are available. Other tablet devices that are compatible with a stylus also work, but these are more expensive and the setup is more involved. Working with Interactive Whiteboarding Google Meet Whiteboard support (Non-collaborative) 1.Use https://canvas.apps.chrome/ for whiteboard support. 2.Present the tab (where the Canvas is open) in the Google meet to students. Whiteboard Support (Collaborative) 1.Use https://jamboard.google.com/ for whiteboard support. 2.Present the tab (where the jamboard is open) in the Google meet to students. 3.Also create a shareable link of the Jamboard and paste it on the Chat window of Google meet 4.Both you and students can write and see the same Jamboard Working with Interactive Whiteboarding Zoom ➢See: Using annotation tools on a shared screen or whiteboard Setting up a Whiteboard session without a dedicated input device The instructor can join the Google/Zoom Meeting from two devices, simultaneously, say a laptop and a tablet. The latter has to (1) be capable of screen sharing, and (2) support a stylus (e.g. Apple Pencil) that allows the instructor to write on the tablet. The instructor can share the tablet’s screen, w hich doubles up as the whiteboard. The other device (laptop) can be used for sharing the instructor's video, and/or monitoring chat messages with student queries. Medium Classrooms (25 < Participants < 50) Medium breakout sessions Medium breakout sessio ns with Zoom “rooms”. Here the same principle as the “small” breakout session applies. The difference is that the groups might grow to become inordinately large. A possible solution is to deputize a more advanced student to lead the discussion, and report out upon the completion of the specified task. ➢See Zoom Managing Video Breakout Rooms . 17 Large Classrooms (50 < Participants) Lectures with Interactive Quizzes It is possible to create slideshows and other lecture materials that incorporate interactive quizzes. In some cases, these can be deployed live, in other modalities they can be used for pre-recorded material. The quizzes are a way to assess real-time understanding of the covered materials. In Google Meet quizzes can be deployed using Google Forms. The score on the quiz is automatically imported into the Classroom Gradebook. ➢Instructional video: Coming Soon Interactive quizzes can also be created with Camtasia. This process is substantially more involved and the grades will not export to Google Classroom automatically. The advantage is that the video and the quiz can be deployed in an asynchronous environment. Asynchronous Pedagogies Overview Not all learning needs to happen within the confines of the allotted meeting slots, and it may be more beneficial for the instructor and the student to re-think the structure of the course in a remote learning environment. These pedagogies are particularly useful when managing a large class. Medium Classrooms (25 < Participants < 50) Pre-recorded materials by students Students can “teach” a particular component of the class by preparing a video presentation in advance of the lecture. Given the constraints of synchronous online communication, this might be a good way to circumvent bandwidth requirements for large classes. There are several collaborative software options available for students to put together the video. The most straightforward way is to encourage students to schedule a Zoom or a Meet session and then record themselves. ➢See: Zoom  Meet Quicktime (Mac only) Large Classrooms (50 < Participants) Pre-Recorded Lectures For large classes, discussion may not be an option. There are several ways in which lectures can be pre- recorded and sent to students. It may not be necessary to create one lecture in its entirety, which can be both time consuming and not very engaging for students. Instead, breaking up long lectures into several shorter topic-based sections may be a more optimal option. 18If you are creating a pre-recorded lecture in a short time frame, consider a few simple tips.5 ❏Provide an explicit roadmap at the beginning. ❏Break down the lecture into shorter segments. A long pre-recorded lecture can be deadly boring to watch. ❏Intersperse the lecture clips with reflection questions for the students to consider. Try to make the learning experience “inductive” rather than entirely didactic. ❏Speak to the student, not to the camera. ❏Insert yourself – a personal story, humor, or editorial commentary – into the lecture. You don’t need to pre -record the entire lecture. Instead, you can pre-record certain segments of your lecture, such as material you want the students to reflect on before class, and leave the rest to the in-class session. Pre- recording and live needn’t be substitutes; they can serve as powerful complements too. Accessibility tips when recording videos:6 ❏Enable Closed Captioning in Google Meet for videos. ❏Keep recordings under 10 minutes. ❏Verbally describe any images or props you show in the video or include textual descriptions below the video. Adding Interactivity It is possible to integrate quizzes in a video lecture using Camtasia. This process is time consuming on the front end, but once created the video and questions can be reused in subsequent semesters. Another option is to upload lecture videos to YouTube and then embed those videos in a Google Quiz. Students watch part of the lecture, and subsequently answer questions. Although visually clunkier, this has the added advantage of directly exporting the quiz score to Google Classroom. ➢See: Creating interactive quizzes with Google Forms Suggested Tools: ➢See: Camtasia  How to Record your Lecture with PowerPoint in Zoom   Google Meet 5 “Best Practices: Online Pedagogy,” accessed April 4, 2020, https://teachremotely.harvard.edu/best- practices . 6 Cornell Resource Library. “Getting Started with Panopto.” Cornell University, accessed: 03/04/2020. URL: https://canvas.cornell.edu/courses/1848/pages/getting- started- in-panopto 19Discussion Board7 To remove technical hurdles and to ensure that students are able to engage with peers and each other in a discussion-based class, you might choose to move student discussion to an asynchronous format. Create a discussion forum to facilitate communication, encourage students to interact, ask questions and respond to discussion prompts. Pedagogical recommendations: ➢Craft discussion questions to be as clear and as specific as possible so that students can build off of the question for a sustained response. ○See Stanford TeachingCommons’ “Designing Effective Discussion Questions” ○See “Conversation Starters: Orchestrating Asynchronous Discussion to Build Academic Community among First- Year Writers” by Dan Seward ➢Assign roles to students so that they understand when and how they might respond to you or their peers. For example, students might “role play” as particular kinds of respondents or you might ask them to do particular tasks (e.g. be a summarizer, a respondent, a connector with outside resources). Google Classroom will allow you to create discussion questions for students, and moderate the discussion in various ways. Responses to the discussion questions can also be graded and automatically recorded in Classroom’s gradebook. ➢See: Create a discussion question in Google Classroom Annotated Slides Pre-recording lectures can be very labor intensive. To simplify matters, one can also send the slide deck w ith notes. This “low -tech” solution is actually beneficial to students who have bandwidth issues and cannot watch the lectures in real-time or as a recording. For some students this is actually an easier way to learn than listening. Links to external sources Although never a replacement for your own teaching, there is a wealth of learning material available online. Some core concepts in your discipline may have been covered by other educators. It does not always make sense to reinvent the wheel, especially when faced with a time crunch. ➢See: Jove ibiology 7 Cohn, Jenae and Beth Seltzer, “Teaching Effectively During Times of Disruption,” Google Docs, accessed April 5, 2020, https://docs.google.com/document/d/1ccsudB2vwZ_GJYoKlFzGbtnmftGcXwCIwxzf- jkkoCU/preview?usp=embed_facebook . 20Overview: Low Stakes and High Stakes Assignments In Engaging Ideas , John Bean broadly defines two types of assessment in the classroom: low-stakes and high-stakes.8 Low-stakes are weighted lower percentage-wise, but are more frequent and informal, high-stakes assignments are weighted higher but more infrequent. Both types of assignments are valuable measures of student engagement and learning. In a remote setting, there may be a need for more frequent “low -stakes” assignments to encourage student engagement. Meanwhile, “high -stakes” assignments are a valuable way to assess student mastery of content, but, given the online setting, are more susceptible to academic dishonesty. Low Stakes Assignments Entry Slips/Exit Slips Before the start of class students come up with a critical question about the material they were meant to prepare for that day. At the end of the session they make clear what they learned and how they would answer the question they posed. A very simple grading scheme of check+, check, check-, or 3, 2, 1 can make grading these relatively quick, while at the same time gauging student participation. Automated Quizzes This could be done through mechanisms like the Quiz feature of Google Classrooms. The instructors can prepare quizzes based on the material covered every week. There are a range of possible quiz question types, including: short answer, long answer, multiple choice, multiple select, and more complex question types. High Stakes Assignments Exams Generally proctoring exams in an online environment is very challenging. The level of student surveillance required to make sure there is no academic dishonesty during synchronous exams, also enhances the chances of technical problems for students. Even with a high level of surveillance, it is not possible to guarantee that students will not engage in academic dishonesty. If there is no other way to do the assessment for a course special arrangements can be made with IT for online synchronous proctoring. Modified Take Home Exams Depending on the course being offered, instructors can decide to offer take home exams, which could be “open book” and “open internet.” The idea is to create a set of questions that help students provide logical arguments, or design choices for the possibly open- ended set of questions being posed to them. The exam can be posted on Google Classroom and made available at a specific date and time. The various question types available in the 8 Bean, John C. Engaging Ideas: The Professor's Guide to Integrating Writing, Critical Thinking, and Active Learning in the Classroom . The Jossey-Bass Higher and Adult Education Series. 2nd ed. San Francisco: Jossey- Bass, 2011. 22Google Classroom Quiz feature, should be able to cover most exam types. Otherwise, students can also submit a file as their response. Take Home Exams and Academic Dishonesty The possibility of illicit or collaborative exploitation of intellectual resources is particularly high with regard to take-home exams. There is no way to guarantee that a student does not consult unsanctioned resources. There are several ways to mitigate the possibility or make it less desirable: Fixed time window: Deploying and receiving the exam in a specific window of time prevents the possibility of collaboration and other forms of academic dishonesty. Google Classroom will allow you to regulate when the exam is posted and lock when the exam can be received. Note that students have expressed that this method can be quite stressful, because if there is a power outage or another technical issue it could prevent them from turning in the exam on time. Similarity check: Google Classroom now has an integrated similarity check that can be used for exams. Alternatively, exams can be passed through Turnitin to check whether students directly copied answers. ➢See: Best Practices for Online Exam Design - Pepperdine University 23Unlike theory-based courses, practical courses are generally of longer durations and require specialized infrastructure support. In addition to this, moving practical courses online results in students taking more time to become familiar with the learning material, internalize how(s) and why(s) of each step in the practical and critically analyse the concepts presented. Their peer-learning ecosystem is also disrupted. Therefore online teaching/learning of such courses may not provide the desired result and learning experience. However, some of the suggestions below may be helpful, to a certain extent, in learning the subject matter and building relevant and useful skill(s)-set : 1.Re-organizing of the order of courses between monsoon and spring semester. ➢Lab courses scheduled in monsoon 2020 may be shifted (postponed) to spring 2021, and replacement theory based courses scheduled in spring 2021 may be brought forward to be taught in the monsoon 2020 semester. 2.In case reorganization of courses as mentioned in #1 (above) is not possible, the course coordinators may consider, a.Re-evaluate learning objectives and outcomes by re-designing the course curriculum to incorporate in-silico experiments/demonstrations and/or analysis of data obtained from these experiments/demonstrations.. b.Livestream / Recorded demonstrations of the laboratory experiments The course coordinators and/or instructional support staff may demonstrate the experiments in the lab and choose to stream the experiment demonstration live (synchronous) or record pictures/ videos of different parts of the experiments (asynchronous). The gathered data could be shared with the students to analyse and make observations. If possible, the students may be allowed to perform these experiments upon their return to the campus. c.Virtual Labs There are a number of ways (listed below) that allow students to approximate laboratory experience through active participation rather than passive observation, virtually. Most of the virtual labs listed in the link below are extremely discipline specific and there is a significant range in quality, but might offer a temporary stopgap, until the students return to the campus: https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/18iVSIeOqKjj58xcR8dYJS5r YvzZ4X1UGLWhl3brRzCM/htmlview 25Office Hours Meeting students outside of class hours can be a challenge. Although it is possible to schedule a running Google Meet for office hours and propagate it in the course calendar, there is no way to anticipate who will show up, or to establish a queue for students. One efficient way to schedule office hours is through the scheduling software Calendly . You can create meeting slots for your students who can then sign up. If a student signs up, it will place that meeting on your Google calendar, and block the slot for other students. You can also change your availability on the calendar, so you never need to inform students of when your office hours are, just give them the link. ➢See: Connect Calendly to Zoom 27Academic Integrity The remote learning environment brings with it a different set of challenges with regard to academic integrity. Fortunately, many of the core principles that help prevent academic dishonesty in an in-person classroom also apply to a virtual classroom. In general, it is better to prevent academic dishonesty through assignment design and deployment than through punitive means after the fact.9 1.Ask open-ended critical questions that require unique answers. 2.Scaffold large assignments into smaller parts that help you track student progress , and reduce the chance of plagiarism. 3.Students are more likely to commit academic dishonesty on a singular high-stakes assignment than several low-stakes assignments cumulatively worth the same weight. Spreading assignments out over the course of the semester can lower student anxiety, and reduce the need to resort to getting non-sanctioned support for an assignment. 4.Academic dishonesty is not the same in every course or even for every assignment. Be explicit as to what resources students can use to complete their assignment. May they consult old exams? Work with fellow students on a paper? Work with material they wrote for a previous class? Clarifying what constitutes academic dishonesty for a specific assignment can prevent misunderstandings. 5.Students are less likely to cheat when the scope and requirements for an assignment are clear. 6.Explicitly stating that you use plagiarism prevention software, and demonstrating the software can act as a strong deterrent. 7.Reminding students of the Academic Integrity policy and the consequences of committing a violation has been shown to reduce cheating. 8.Allowing students to signal in their paper when they are uncertain about how to use a source can create a productive learning moment. 9 Some of the language here has been adapted from the site on Remote Learning and Academic Integrity created by the Library and Technology services department at Lehigh University. “Remote Learning and Academic Integrity | Library & Technology Services.” Accessed August 4, 2020. https://lts.lehigh.edu/remote-learning-and-academic-integrity . 29Student Recommendations The recommendations below have been collated by the student representatives from all departments. They offer an overview of the most pressing concerns for students, and practices they have found successfully address those concerns. Attendance Policy for Synchronous Learning Issues: (i) Students might have varied household conditions, and may not be able to adhere to attendance requirements. (ii) Technical issues can also be an obstacle for class attendance. (iii) International students might not be able to join synchronous classes. Solution: (i) Owing to difficult circumstances, students found it really helpful when professors clearly delineated what constituted an excused and an unexcused absence, and the number allowed for each course. (ii) One particularly productive way in which one professor dealt with students not being able to attend synchronous sessions was by creating optional assignments that counted towards attendance. High Stakes and Low Stakes Assignments Issues: (i) It is more difficult to properly schedule time for doing assignments at home. Both because students may have household commitments to attend to, and because they may get too much screen time in one day. Scheduling becomes even more challenging when high stakes and low stakes assignments are not properly defined at the beginning of the semester. (ii) For courses following a Midterm-Final paper/exam format, the lack of low-stakes assignments adds more pressure on students who may not be able to perform evenly on exams/final papers due to personal or technical reasons. (iii) It becomes challenging for students to complete high-stakes assignments without access to the required resources, such as books, scholarly articles, and other research materials. (iv) Since almost all of the course content is now digital, it has become more difficult for students to keep up with the readings due to screen fatigue. Solution: (i) Students are better able to organize their time when the high and low stake assignments are clearly defined at the start of the semester for every course. (ii) For courses following a Midterm-Final paper/exam format, more low-stakes assignments provide more opportunities for students to properly showcase their knowledge than a high pressure situation like an exam of final paper. (iii) All resources for high-stakes assignments should be provided beforehand, for example, in a shared google drive folder for the class. For assignments where this is not 31possible, grading curves should be cognizant of any uneven resource distribution among students. (iv) Students found it more effective to do several short readings, as opposed to one very long reading that causes screen fatigue. Procedure for Remote Examinations Issues: (i) Households do not provide the same composed and undisturbed setup as classrooms in terms of taking examinations, leading to an inability to focus. (ii) Unexpected technical issues or power cuts might further hinder exam performance and submission. Solution: (i) An example that worked really well for students was allotting extra time for remote exams in anticipation of technical difficulties and/or interruptions in the test taker’s location. (ii) Students found it really beneficial when there were multiple quizzes/exams, and only the best scores were taken into consideration to provide more buffer for students who may underperform due to technical or circumstantial issues. Assessing Class Participation for Synchronous and Asynchronous Classes. Issues: (i) Remote learning makes it difficult for students to participate in all class activities. (ii) Larger class sizes and technical difficulties also impact class participation. Solution: (i) An example that really worked for students was when the professor assessed class participation only on the basis of the quality of participation shown in the classes the student was able to partake in. (ii) Students found that weekly discussion posts on online platforms (such as Canvas and Piazza) were able to engage with the class better when they were the primary criteria to grade them for class participation. Recorded Lectures for Asynchronous Classes Issues: (i) In an asynchronous setting, students might find it difficult to continuously engage in recorded lectures. (ii) A lack of student-teacher interaction might further disengage students from the recorded lecture format and hinder the Q/A or feedback process. Solution: (i) Students found it easiest to follow lectures that were broken down into smaller sections and that covered discrete topics. 32(ii) Some of the best lectures were those where the instructor's face was visible, because it was easier to engage with the material. (iii) Students felt more engaged and involved when instructors occasionally held synchronous meetings to discuss the lecture material with students. (iv) Students found one- on-one short feedback sessions conducted by instructors to be the most effective for clearing queries and concerns about the course or materials. 33\", 'metadata': None} score: 0.5946526\n",

The education at Ashok a emphasizes foundational knowledge, thorough academic resear ch based on rigor ous pedagogy , and hands-on experience with real-w orld challenges. Ashok a University envisions its Biological Science programme to be the corner stone of its Natural Sciences Programme. Built on the foundations of Chemistr y and Physics and drawing upon the resour ces of other disciplines such as Data Sciences, Climat e and Environmental Studies, and Social Sciences and Humanities, the Biological Science programme at Ashok a will seek unique directions in and catalyse the emergence of new areas of resear ch. This handbook brings to you our philosophy of teaching and training in the diverse areas of life sciences, along with a list of current faculty and their research areas and accomplishments, details of teaching and research infrastructure, the and undergraduate and post-graduate curricula with syllabi. 1INTRODUCTION TO THE BIOLOGICAL SCIENCES PROGR AMME Bioscience at Ashok a has adopt ed multi-dimensional appr oaches to study biology across various scales. These range from molecules to cells, tissues to individuals, and organisms to ecosyst ems. With a foundation laid in Chemistr y and Physics, this programme also involves under standing and learning from other disciplines such as Data Sciences, Climat e and Environmental Sciences, Social Sciences, and Humanities. Students and faculty at Ashok a are equal partners in this journe y. Our collectiv e aim is to generat e new knowledge and explore its applications to address social problems. While breadth across all scales of size and complexity in the life sciences is important for education and training in the undergraduat e and post-graduat e levels, we do give sufﬁcient attention to the depth that is needed for productiv e resear ch outcomes. In this direction, we have recently established The Trivedi School of Biosciences with the help of a gener ous donation from Mr. Ashok Trivedi. The school promotes advanced resear ch in Synthe tic Biology , Data Science, and emerging areas in disease biology . The school envisages state-of-the-ar t infrastructure, strengthening faculty number s in complementar y thematic areas, and continuous suppor t and ment orship in the pursuit of high-q uality resear ch capable of generating meaningful social impacts. The strength of Ashok a lies in its highly qualiﬁed faculty across all disciplines. Our bioscience faculty come trained from all over the world and are some of the best in their respectiv e ﬁelds, with expertise in areas that are not represent ed in India. Our faculty also: ® Innovate in biology education. ® Carry out experimental, computational/mathematical/theore tical biology resear ch. ® Collaborat e with afﬁliat ed faculty from other disciplines such as physics, chemistr y, mathematics, and data science who work on biological problems; the afﬁliat ed faculty also contribut e to teaching the students in the Biological Sciences programme. 2OVERVIEW OF UNDERGR ADUATE PROGR AM Students of Ashok a start by querying the growth of human thought, the origin and growth of the human civilization in general, and the Indian civilization in particular . They are introduced to the origin of scientiﬁc inquiry and study the relationships and inter-dependencies between science and other domains of human creativity and critical thinking. On this foundation, the fundamental principles of physics are taught to all students, in a way that brings in both, the elegance of the principles of the natural world, and the complexity that still needs be unra veled. Subseq uently , students are introduced to the chemical, biological, and human w orlds, no t as independent disciplines, but as a continuum of the ph ysical w orld. Mathematics is taught as a language that connects all these disciplines of science and also as an abstract method by which we under stand our surroundings. Our model of education is concept-based and inq uiry-driven, as opposed t o the more traditional cont ent- based models. Faculty at Ashok a pursue resear ch in those areas that are relat ed to the topics they teach to undergraduat e students. Our vision is to integrat e resear ch and teaching at all levels of science education. The Sciences at Ashok a will be rooted in experiments, but will not take the rigid “objectiv es, apparatus, method, and conclusion” form. Students learn through both, courses taught in the classr ooms, and by employing experimental methods in resear ch labs of the faculty . Students are also exposed to frontier s of science through seminar s, symposia, and national and international conferences that are routinely organized on the campus of Ashok a. The undergraduat e program in Biology is targe ted at students who have strong interests in Biology (Biology Major s) as well as those who are interest ed in learning more about Biology or for meeting their scientiﬁc temperament needs (Biology Minor s). Cour ses are taught keeping in mind that some students may or may not have prior exposure to basic concepts of Biology . All students majoring in the Sciences will have an oppor tunity to learn how to design an experiment and to implement that design, ﬁguring out the art of the appr oximation, under standing the power of simple models and how to conceptualize them, and developing the ability to convert an idea into mathematical or computational forms. The contents of the courses themselv es are equivalent in every way to those that are taught at the best universities outside of and within India. The Sciences at Ashok a will be rooted in experiments, but these will not take the rigid “objectiv es, apparatus, method, conclusion” form. At Ashok a, students will transf er concepts learnt in class into experimental thinking, verifying for themselv es the power and generality of scientiﬁc principles. Cour ses for Biology major s will provide a strong foundation for resear ch and career s in the biological sciences, medicine, pharmaceutical and biotech industr y, teaching, and other relat ed ﬁelds. A prospectiv e Biology major student is required to complete 11 core courses in Biology and 5 of the several optional courses offered in the Sciences along with the mandat ory 7 foundation courses. 3OVERVIEW OF P .D. PROGR AM h Ashok a University's Ph.D. program is designed to maintain global standar ds in education, training, productivity , and academic freedom. The Ph.D. program in Biological Sciences is charact erized by state-of-the-ar t laborat ories and computational infrastructure, gener ous suppor t to carryout ﬁeld work, accom plished faculty as resear ch ment ors, and gener ous scholar ship remunerations to all students. The unique liberal arts environment of the campus allows Ph.D. students to work on inter-disciplinar y resear ch projects drawing on the expertise of faculty member s within and beyond the biology depar tment. The four broad thematic areas that charact erize our resear ch are: 1. Bioph ysics and Biochemistr y 2. Cell and Developmental Biology 3. Com putational and Mathematical Biology 4. Ecology and Evolutionar y Biology All Ph.D. students under take complementar y course work to enable them to carry out resear ch in the areas of their interest. Ashok a gives maximum importance to training Ph.D. students in resear ch methodology , integrity , ethics, and written/oral communication. In addition, all Ph.D. students will have an oppor tunity to gain teaching experience by helping the faculty in teaching undergraduat e students. 4ADVANCED DIPL OMA The Biology Depar tment also offers a structured program for students who are interest ed in learning advanced concepts in biology and gain experience in some of the modern and interdisciplinar y areas of biology . This is in the form of an advanced diploma for students who have ﬁnished 3 years of undergraduat e in biology and relat ed area. The program is for one year. The major emphasis is to give oppor tunity to students to learn some of the advance and contemporar y topics in biology along with a hand-on experience in conducting research. Students with a major in a different disciple (chemistr y/ph ysics/maths/com puter science) are also eligible to join the Biology program. There is an oppor tunity to carry out interdisciplinar y resear ch in a number of areas in Biology . The program has been designed keeping in mind appr opriat e courses to ﬁll knowledge in gap areas and offer signiﬁcant resear ch oppor tunities UG LABS WITH ST ATE-OF-ART FACILITIES AND SAFETY FEA TURESSAFETY FEA TURES OUTSIDE LABS UG LABS 5Alok Bhatt acharya is Professor of Biology .

These have attract ed audiences ranging from high school students to international and national policy makers. Some of the conferences and meetings held last year were: Muscle and Diseases; Recent Advances in Under standing Disease Biology; Seminar Series on Ecology and Evolution; and Gene tics and Evolution: Intertwined Strands. These have been signiﬁcant in forging collaborations and providing a platf orm for students and faculty to exchange scientiﬁc ideas. Darwin-W allace Symposium The Darwin-Wallace student symposium is held every year in the month of November/December to give undergraduat e students an oppor tunity to discuss and present their resear ch on diverse aspects of ecology and evolution, ranging from climat e change and biodiv ersity, to the evolution of antibio tic resistance and modelling disease spread. Biology Colloquium During the academic year, we organise weekly colloq uia with international and national speak ers from different universities and specialisations within biology (on topics ranging from molecular gene tics to ecosyst ems ecology). We ensure that the list of invited speak ers reﬂect our inclusiv e outlook . Furthermore, we ensure that the majority of these talks reach beyond disciplinar y boundaries; this encourages students to pursue interdisciplinar y resear ch. These weekly colloq uia are followed by informal interaction sessions with the speak ers over pizza or a coffee. This tradition provides our students with an oppor tunity to ask questions relat ed to the speak ers' personal journe ys, resear ch traject ories, and the challenges that they have encount ered. 15A MESSA GE FROM ASHOKA'S STUDENT -LED SOCIETY OF BIOLOGY, THE BIOSOC: The Ashok a Biology Socie ty is a student-driv en initiativ e that brings together all aspects of the biological sciences to celebrat e them and make them more accessible to the student community .

The answ er to this question lies within the inherit ed DNA. Gene tics have evolved phenomenally since Mendel ﬁrst introduced the concept of genes during the mid-1 800s. Today gene tics is used in all phases of life from food to medicines, new disco veries tend to manipulat e gene tics not only to diagnose and ﬁnd better cure for deadly diseases like cancer but also to design smar t plants and microbes to enhance the quality and quantity of food and secondar y metabolit es such as biofuel. Hence a thorough knowledge of gene tics is an absolut e requirement for biologists to comprehend the complex living organisms. This course will help you to acquire a thorough knowledge about the principles and concept of gene tics. We will start with the seminal disco veries chr onologically that led t o our under standing of gene tics t oday. Speciﬁcally , you will learn in details about inheritance of the gene tic materials and traits, structure and function of chromosomes and genes, mapping genes on the chromosome. We will then move on to study the key areas of gene tic variation and molecular gene tics and focus on model organisms used for gene tic studies.

It carries out all (well… almost all!) the physiological processes essential for its survival and propagation. Within the cell, each of these processes is accom plished by molecular - machines. What are these processes and how do these mini machines carry out the cellular functions? How do these cellular machines know the right place and the right time to carry out appropriate functions? In this introduct ory Cell and Molecular Biology course, we will start by exploring some of the essential processes at the cellular level and under stand how the relevant molecular machines manage to carry out these processes with such amazing ﬁdelity and efﬁciency . The primar y focus of this course will be on eukaryotic cells, but as and when needed we will draw comparisons with prokaryotic cellular processes to appreciat e their similarities and distinctness. By the end of this course, the participant is expect ed to have a good conceptual grasp on basic cellular mechanisms, the molecular machineries involved, and their functional regulation within a cell.

I will start with very basic concepts and then slowly pace up to more advanced topics. During the course, I will primarily emphasize on two major aspects – (1) How do biologists infer the processes that contribut e to evolution? (2) Why is the under standing of evolutionar y patterns and processes critical for diverse areas of biological resear ch? In addition, I will also brieﬂy discuss (1) how do we read the primar y scientiﬁc literature? (2) How do we write about science? At the end of this course, I hope that the students will develop a broad under standing of the k ey concepts and theories in e volutionar y biology , including principles of natural selection and variation, sexual selection, population gene tics, quantitativ e gene tics, speciation and biodiv ersity, molecular evolution, co-evolution, and life history evolution. Finally and most importantly , I do not expect all the students to become professional evolutionar y biologists – but whether they become astrobiologist, athle tes, bureaucrats, entrepreneur s, movie stars or medical practitioner s, I hope that if they ever think about biology , they will be capable of appreciating the lens of evolutionar y processes.

We will begin with how ecological under standing is achie ved, how conditions and resour ces inﬂuence individual species and then move to processes at higher levels of organization and end with rethinking some of the big questions in ecology . The topics covered will incluse physiological ecology , population ecology , species interactions, community ecology , succession and disturbance; ecosyst em ecology , and biogeochemistr y. Topics introduced in the lectures will be followed by in class-activities (and simulations) and discussions.

The course will allow to reﬂect on uncertainty and variation in natural processes from individual behaviour to ecosystem services. It is recommended strongly to take evolutionar y biology course prior to this, since this course will build on some of the modules covered in that course. Towards the end of this course, students will be able to (a) under stand how ecologists empirically study processes occurring at various scales and apply evolutionar y thinking to these processes (b) integrat e proximat e and ultimat e factors to under stand natural processes (c) quantitativ ely synthesize ecological resear ch (d) explore applications of ecological concepts such as conser vation, landscape management.

We will start by under standing how single neur ons can perform computations and can be under stand in the same frame work as electr onic circuitr y. We will under stand then how complex information processing and calculation can happen as a result of the ways in which multiple neur ons signal to and connect to one another. We will then look at how the brain is organized, and study the nervous systems of humans and other animals, appr oaching this through the lens of the various tools that neur oscientists have historically used to study neur onal connectivity and the brain. We will cover the electrical proper ties of nerve cells and voltage dependent membrane permeability; channels, transpor ters, neur otransmitt ers and their recept ors; synaptic transmission; the brain and its development and plasticity . We will also study complex brain functions and the neural basis of complex cognition, learning and information processing. We explore the ways in which the neur onal processes underlying beha viour have been deduced from various animal models of beha viour , and ways in which gene tics and the environment shape the systems that produce beha viour during development. We will explore sensor y perception and motor movement. We then turn to the question of how we learn, how we absorb new material, at the neural basis of complex and interesting phenomena such as motivation, emotion, cognition, consciousness, attention. We will end with an exploration of how neural systems can exhibit pathology , how neur odegeneration and trauma can impact the system, and how medication and drugs work.

This question has been addressed by various disciplines, including the ﬁelds of “Evolutionar y Psychology”, “Sociobiology” and “Physical Anthopology”. The common problem with the construction of the frame work of these ﬁelds is the chain of untested assum ptions underlying it, and the development of ideas unmoored to the physiological basis of either evolution or cognition. We will break down each model used to teach Evolutionar y Psychology to critically examine each system, and each system feeds into a larger under standing of what is involved in the evolution of cognitiv e abilities. This course looks at the question of whether there are aspects of beha viour and cognition that do and do not seem to have evolved in particular evolutionar y contexts. The ﬁrst step in our critical examination is to under stand what evolution does and does not mean in a Darwinian frame work; as well as whether and how cognition can be deﬁned and accurat ely assessed. We look at what aspects of beha viour are hardwired, and what is plastic. We under stand that evolution pertains to gene tic changes, and get a quick under standing of what gene tics constitut es. We then learn about epigenetics, gene expression, how the framework of genes and their expression drives physiological development of an embr yo, how the brain develops as a subse t of the body from a gene tic frame work, and about the relativ e ridigity and plasticity of parts of the brain during development and in adulthood. We then visit various questions in evolutionar y cognition, focussing on the historical debat es between the people who began extending the frame work of e volution t o under stand beha viour and cognition. The learning goals f or this class are to primarily learn how to distinguish an evidence-based under standing of evolutionar y cognition from what have been called “just-so” stories, which clog the public and even scientiﬁc realm.

Organisms use different strat egies depending upon their nature as well as the environment. These strat egies evolve towards better adaptation and help in the perpetuation of life. In this course, we will study the strat egies used by different types of organisms and try to correlat e these with evolution. Student evaluation will be based on class participation, a resear ch paper , and mid-semest er and ﬁnal examinations.

This mentor is available by appointment to discuss all academic issues including course selection, academic planning and liaising with another faculty. In semester 3, once the student has declared her major, the mentor is replaced by a Major Advisor- a faculty member from the chosen major discipline, who takes over the duties of the Faculty Mentor. Do encourage your student to meet with her mentor/ advisor regularly.   In the first semester, students fill in a Foundation Course Preference Form. 3 or 4 Foundation Courses are assigned to the student on the basis of this form through an algorithm. One section of Introduction to Critical Thinking, a mandatory course, may also be assigned through the same algorithm. \\xa0All students are also encouraged to attend the Orientation Sessions held by academic departments to get a sense of the kind of study involved in each discipline. At the end of semester 1, students must meet with their Faculty Mentor prior to registering for the next semester’s classes. Faculty Mentors and later Academic Advisors discuss requirements and help students develop a plan for the upcoming semesters.   Students view their grades through the Learning Management System. Parents and families can’t access student grades directly. We encourage you to maintain open lines of communication with your students so that they feel confident enough to share their grades with you. If a student is placed on academic review due to consistently poor performance, a letter is sent to the student and the parent.   First talk with your student about what resources are available on campus. They can (and should) talk with their faculty advisor and current faculty about getting help with assignments or they may visit the Center for Writing and Communication ( CWC), the tutoring and academic assistance center. If your student is unable to access these resources or if it seems too late for this to be helpful, have your student meet with an officer from the Office of Academic Affairs. The student can also, either on the advice of the mentor/ advisor or independently, seek extra help from the Office of Learning Support. Such support may also be provided on the recommendation of any of the student’s course instructors.   Economics, Psychology, Political Science and Computer Science have had the highest number of majors in recent years, but since all our Major Departments have excellent faculty, your student will be well-served in any of the programmes on offer.   The Ashoka Scholars Programme is a year- long postgraduate diploma that offers undergraduate students an exciting opportunity to broaden their academic horizons or acquire a deeper skill set in their chosen field of study. The programme gives students a distinct advantage over other undergraduate students in the job market, as well as for postgraduate study. In addition, students who want to pursue a Masters or a PhD degree abroad need an equivalent of a four-year undergraduate degree – e.g. in the US, but also elsewhere. The ASP year works very well to meet that requirement. More details of the ASP programme can be found here.   The break between Spring and Monsoon semester is called the Summer Semester. Students are encouraged to use this time for internships, independent study projects or to participate in Study Abroad opportunities. The University also offers an intensive six-week study programme, during the summer for undergraduate students. A range of four-credit courses is offered across disciplines. Enrolling for the summer term provides an opportunity for Ashoka students to take courses that helps to gain additional credits, accelerate in their academic pathway or simply explore other areas of interest. Specific programs change each year and students learn of them through departmental emails and postings around campus.   The Office of International Programmes provides Ashoka students with a range of resources and services as they explore international study abroad options, whether it is for the summer or a semester. The best advice we can offer for parent involvement is for you to learn as much as you can about the country where your student will be studying so you can ask good questions (and communicate often) while they are abroad. For more information, please visit Study Abroad webpage.     We currently have five Residence Halls on campus, which are located adjacent to each other and close to the Dining Hall making it convenient to visit friends and go for meals. The halls have between 7-10 floors with about 20-35 rooms on each floor. Each floor has its own set of bathrooms with showers, toilets and sinks. The rooms are allotted on a twin sharing basis and are furnished with two beds and mattresses, book racks, wardrobes, study desks and chairs. Each room also has windows to allow for adequate natural light. The Common Rooms on the ground floor of each Hall come equipped with upholstered chairs, couches and tables to accommodate work and social interactions.   The University is required to assign student housing based on the gender designation in their official University record (through the Office of the Registrar). Incoming students are assigned roommates with the help of relevant information provided by them through the ‘Roommate Matching’ form. Returning students are allowed to choose their preferred roommate through the ‘Roommate Preference’ form. All batches of students are allotted roommates from within their own batch.   No student is allowed to change their allotted room or roommate without official authorization. However, students may request a room change for reasons such as non- functioning of room facilities or any other difficult room experience such as roommate conflicts. We strongly encourage roommates to first communicate with one another carefully and responsibly in an attempt to improve their living situation. If that does not lead to positive outcomes, the student can approach their Resident Assistant (RA) about the conflict; the RA will initiate a mediation process to address the conflict in the best possible manner. After the mediation, further options may also be explored to ensure a healthy living environment for the student.   Students can meet off-campus visitors in the Residence Halls’ common room only between 8:00 am and 8:00 pm. Visitors do not have access to the student rooms and won’t be allowed on campus premises outside the stipulated hours. Students are allowed to visit each other’s rooms in different Residence Halls irrespective of their gender at all times between 08:00 am to 12:30 am.   Yes. Students can use the pantry area on each floor, which is equipped with an induction plate, microwave oven, refrigerator and has common storage cupboards and dishwashing area. However, students are not allowed to use any personal appliances (coffee makers, mini-fridge, induction/hot plates, etc.) inside the Residence Halls.   In an effort to encourage a comfortable studying and resting environment for all students, Quiet Hours on campus, including the Residence Halls, are to be observed between 01:00 am to 07:00 am every day. During Quiet Hours, students are expected to refrain from playing music or creating loud noise in the Residence Hall rooms, washrooms, hallways etc.   Ashoka offers a web of extracurricular activities, striking a fine balance between activities that are fun and those that are intellectually challenging. Students are encouraged to pursue their hobbies and interests through an array of existing Clubs and Societies \\xa0and also have the opportunity to initiate new clubs or societies, subject to relevant policies. Information about events and activities conducted by these student groups is shared regularly with the entire Ashoka community through email, social media, and campus postings. There is also a range of active and invigorating Sports Programmes across a dozen disciplines, complete with world-class facilities.     Subscription to dining services as per the minimum cover charge is mandatory for all the students. Meals over the value of the cover charge are charged at cost per meal. Various eateries on campus offer further variety in food, some of which remain open through the night with delivery options for students’ convenience. The general provisions shop on campus stocks some fresh fruit in addition to packaged items.   Dining Services is able to accommodate some dietary needs/restrictions and under special medical circumstances can work with students to meet their requirements, including developing a plan that may include special menu items, ingredient identification, special preparation, and communication to necessary staff to ensure that your student can eat safely. Please contact the    The University provides primary health care services, including minor emergency treatment such as burns, minor lacerations, sprains, or strains to all students. A doctor and paramedical staff are available on campus 24*7. Medicines and tests prescribed by the resident doctor are available on chargeable basis.   In case of severe illnesses the parents or the family are informed immediately. The student (if medically alert and conscious), will also be kept in loop while notifying the parent(s) or guardian. For emergencies, the University has an arrangement with Max Hospital, Shalimar Bagh. A medical ambulance is available on campus 24*7. All students of the University are covered under an insurance of INR 1 Lac applicable upon hospitalization of 24 hours or more.   Encourage your student to seek help anytime she is feeling anxious, having sudden mood changes, or there is some sort of distress, feelings of helplessness or confusion, academic pressures, relationship troubles or adjustment issues. She could: speak with her student residential assistant (RA). Residential life staff are trained to assist students with accessing campus resources; make an appointment at Ashoka Center for Well Being (ACWB). The counseling center offers 24-hour mental health services and a myriad of other counseling services. The counseling center is open to all Ashoka students free of charge.    Obtaining counseling services is an individual decision. If you feel like your student may benefit from counseling, talk to them. Explain your thoughts and feelings. Remember, they are adults now, beginning to make their own decisions and only they can decide if counseling is a service they wish to obtain. Ultimately, the choice is theirs. Understanding Transition is a session for students and parents held by the Ashoka Center for Well Being( ACWB) each year during Orientation Week. We strongly encourage you to attend it.     Ashoka University is now a preferred destination for several leading recruiters across the corporate and social sector. \\xa0The CDO assists students in aligning their aptitude with their interests and skills, and guides them to pursue fulfilling opportunities. CDO offers unlimited one-to-one counselling, resume workshops, mock interviews, and skill-building workshops, and hosts a multitude of eminent professionals from diverse industries to share their experiences . \\xa0Read more about career development opportunities here   The Office of Global Education and Strategic Programmes provides regular support to students exploring higher education opportunities by organizing Graduate Information Sessions and Town Halls. In addition, the office staff meet students frequently to provide assistance relevant to the students’ interests and academic journeys, including with programme applications, visa applications and scholarship opportunities. Information on interesting research internships and other unique opportunities is communicated through emails and campus postings.     International students face changes in nearly every aspect of their life when they leave home to study abroad. Changes in diet, sleeping patterns and climate may affect their health and well-being. Students should provide a copy of their medical records, including immunizations and vaccinations, to the health center when they arrive on campus. These records should show all medicines or treatments the student is using. This will help doctors, and other health care professionals provide safe care if the student has a new health problem. Under normal circumstances, students are expected to keep family members informed of their illnesses. However, the Office of Student Life will notify the family in the event of serious illness or accident that requires extensive treatment or hospitalization. All students of the University are covered under an insurance of INR 1 Lac applicable upon hospitalization of 24 hours or more.   Mobile SIM cards may be obtained at the SIM Card kiosk on campus, after completing all necessary documentation. Detailed information and support is provided to students during days of the onboarding of the new cohort in the new academic year. SIM cards are available in prepaid and post-paid segments. CUG and circle portability facility can be availed by the users.   Each international student is paired up with a ‘buddy’, a\\xa0senior\\xa0student who will help the new student negotiate the campus as well as residential and academic life. All staff on campus, including support staff understand some English.\\xa0   For all international students, the Office of Student Affairs in conjunction with the Finance Department will provide assistance in opening a local bank account. They will also be provided support by the IO and Registrar’s Office for registering for the FRRO i.e. Foreigner registration which is a mandatory requirement by the Government of India. Under FRRO all foreign nationals visiting India on a long term visa are required to register themselves with a Registration Officer within 14 days of arriving in India.

FAQs      20         2 Introduction Physics is a doorway to some of the most beautiful and profound phenomena in the universe like black holes, supernovae, Bose -Einstein condensates, superconductors. It is, simultaneously, a driver of lifestyle -changing technology, e.g., engines, electricity, and transistors; and a powerful way of perceiving and analyzing problems that can be applied in various domains, both within and outside standard physics. The beauty and profundity of the phenomena studied by physicists offer romance and excite passion, and the utility of its discoveries and th e power of its methods arouse interest.  These methods can be very intricate and demanding: theoretical physics requires a skilful combination of physical and mathematical thinking, and experimental physics requires in addition the ability to turn tentati ve ideas into physical devices that can put those ideas to the test. As a result, the successful practice of physics demands rigour, flexibility, mechanical adroitness, persistence, and great imagination. The physicist’s imagination is nourished not just b y physics but also by other areas of human enquiry and thought, of the kind that an Ashoka undergraduate is expected to encounter.  With all of this in mind, the physics programme has been designed to: (i) allow students wishing to major in physics to discov er real physics and make a wise choice, in the first year; (ii) provide, throughout, a thorough training in fundamental physics; (iii) bring together everything learnt earlier, and give students the option to pursue more advanced courses in physics or branch out into other areas, in the third year. The idea is to accompany those wishing to become professional physicists as they take the f irst steps in that direction, and to introduce everyone who goes through the programme to the physicist’s way of thinking.     3 Physics Major – Typical Trajectory Semester 2: Discovering UG -level Physics A student wishing to major, minor, or pursue a concentration in Physics is expected to take the introductory course in calculus (Calculus I) offered by the Mathematics Department. Students wishing to major in Physics should plan to take it in their first s emester.  Requirement for Physics major : 13 core physics courses + 2 electives (60 credits)  The physics -major sequence begins in semester 2, with two courses, one in theoretical physics and the other in experimental physics. The first purpose of these c ourses is to provide an experience of UG level physics on the basis of which a student can decide whether or not to major in physics, i.e., they are gateway courses. The second purpose of these courses is to serve as an introduction to the physicist’s way of thinking about problems and solving them, something that has proved useful not just to physicists but also to those in other disciplines that make use of quantitative methods and experiments, e.g., mathematics, computer science, economics, psychology, a nd biology.  Semester 3, 4 and 5: The Physics Core  The physics courses in these 3 semesters form the core of the physicist’s undergraduate canon. Anyone majoring in physics is expected to be thorough in these areas. Each semester has 2 -3 theory courses and an accompanying lab.  Semester 6: Exploring more advanced options  The student can opt for elective courses: each student majoring in physics is required to take at least two. From the student’s point of view, the electives chosen is likely to indicate a post -graduate direction – towards theoretical physics, towards experimental physics or perhaps away from physics into an allied discipline that would benefit from training in physics.        4 Physics Minor or Concentration  To Minor in physics a student must do six courses in physics (24 credits). Of these the two gateway courses – MP1 and Lab 1 – are compulsory. At least two more courses should be taken from among the core courses offered in semesters 3, 4, and 5, provided a ppropriate prerequisites have been satisfied for these courses (recommended courses: Classical Mechanics and Thermal Physics).  The remaining two may be either other compulsory or elective courses offered by the Physics Department or cross -listed with Phy sics, provided appropriate prerequisites have been satisfied. In place of one elective course, a student may take an Independent Study Module (ISM) of equivalent credit.  For a Concentration in physics a student must do six courses in physics (16 credits ). Of these the two gateway courses – MP1 and Lab 1 – are compulsory.  At least two more courses should be taken from among the core courses offered in semesters 3, 4, and 5, provided appropriate prerequisites have been satisfied for these courses (recomm ended courses: Classical Mechanics and Thermal Physics)          5 General Information on the Physics Courses Mathematical level — All theory courses are calculus -based. The level of mathematical sophistication will increase progressively. The mathematical - physics courses will be application -oriented rather than proof -oriented. Familiarity with +2 level physics and mathematics is a ssumed.  Labs — All lab courses will involve extensive use of instruments to make observations. These experiments will in general illustrate ideas studied in the accompanying theory courses.  The use of computers — Many theory courses will include computa tional exercises, generally using the programming language Python. Labs will also require the use of computers.  Duration — Theory courses: two lectures a week each lasting 1.5 hours. In addition, there may be a 1.5 -hour tutorial per week . Laboratory: one 3 -hour main lab session per week and one 3 -hour extra session per week for lab course.  List of Physics Courses Compulsory/Core Courses Mathematical Physics 1 (Gateway course: semester 2) This course aims to familiarise the student with a variety of mathematical techniques which every student of physics should be conversant with. Having taken the course, you should be comfortable with casting a wide variety of physics problems in mathematical language and being able to analyse and solve them subsequently. The course will also include an introduction to programming with Python. Within the physics curriculu m at Ashoka university, this course is an essential prerequisite for Classical Mechanics and Electricity and Magnetism in Light of Relativity offered in the third semester.  Pre-requisites: Students who have not done mathematics at the 12th -grade level are required to take Calculus I.     6 Physics Lab 1 (Gateway course: semester 2) An introduction to physics through experiments. The goal of this introductory lab is to help students develop the skills needed for experimental physics. Students will be introduced to the basic concepts of data collection, analysis, and interpretation over the span of the course by working on different experimental problems which have been carefully selected to represent different branches of physics.  Pre-requis ites: none.  Classical Mechanics (semester 3) Newtonian mechanics and an introduction to Lagrangian and Hamiltonian mechanics. Newtonian mechanics is, both historically and otherwise, the starting point of all of physics. The Lagrangian and Hamiltonian formulations of classical mechanics allow a more profound vision of the subject while also introducing the language in which much of higher -level theoretical physics is expressed.  Pre-requisites: MP1  Electricity & Magnetism in Light of Relativity (semester 3 ) The beautiful theory of electricity and magnetism is, with classical mechanics, the heart of c lassical physics. What is often not appreciated at the undergraduate level is that electricity and magnetism are related in a way that reveals the structure of space -time. In this course relativity will be used from the beginning to relate electric and mag netic fields, so that their unity, as components of the electromagnetic field are revealed and used in the study of Maxwell’s Equations.  Pre-requisites: MP1  Physics Lab 2 (semester 3) Designed to accompany the theory courses Classical Mechanics and Ele ctricity & Magnetism in Light of Relativity, this laboratory course explores their experimental foundations. Students will be introduced to video -analysis and modelling to study elastic and inelastic collisions, uniformly accelerated motion, and terminal v elocity. In addition, students will also be introduced to physical systems exhibiting electromagnetic damping, resonant electronics circuits, and two -dimensional electrostatics.  Pre-requisites: Physics Lab 1      7 Mathematical Physics 2 (semester 4 ) This mathematical physics course aims to be an introduction to differential equations. Besides standard topics in ordinary and partial differential equations, nonlinear dynamical systems will be studied and nonlinear ODEs will be analysed using geometric a nd computational tools. Fourier series will also be studied.  Pre-requisites: MP1  Thermal Physics (semester 4) An Integrated Approach to Thermodynamics and Kinetic Theory. There are three approaches to study systems with large numbers of atoms and molec ules, which exhibit properties like temperature and entropy: kinetic theory, classical thermodynamics, and statistical mechanics. In this course, these three approaches will be taught in an integrated fashion.  Pre-requisites: Mathematical Physics 1.  Oscillations, Waves, and Optics (semester 4) Oscillatory phenomena appear in all areas of physics, both classical and quantum (to the point where a famous textbook begins by saying that the domain of physics is all phenomena that can be reduced to coupled oscillators). The methods used to study oscillatory motion are powerful and wide -ranging in their utility.  Pre-requisites: MP1, Classical Mechanics and Electricity & Magnetism.  Physics Lab 3 (semester 4) Designed to accompany the theory courses Therma l Physics and Oscillations, Waves & Optics, this laboratory course explores their experimental foundations. Students will be introduced to the properties of light as a wave: interference, diffraction, and polarisation, through conceptually rich experiments like the Michelson Interferometer. In addition, mechanical systems which exhibit oscillatory behaviour, like coupled pendula and capillary waves, will also be studied. Students will also be introduced to ideas of thermometry and calibration.  Pre-requisi tes: Physics Lab I.        8 Quantum Mechanics (semester 5) This course is an introduction to Quantum Mechanics (QM). Starting with a historical introduction and motivation, it goes on to introduce probability amplitudes as the fundamental physical basis for QM. Using the Dirac bra -ket notation, the fundamental postulates are then introduced and their consequences worked out. The basic physical concepts are illustrated through spin -½ systems and one -dimensional wave mechanics. Symmetries and Conservation laws in QM are discussed, an introduction to the basic theory of angular momentum and spin is given, and the course culminates with the first major triumph of QM - a quantum mechanical understanding of the hydrogen atom.  Pre-requisites: Classical Mechanics, M athematical Physics I and II.  Strongly recommended: Linear Algebra (Department of Mathematics).  Statistical Mechanics (semester 5) Statistical mechanics allows one to solve problems involving large numbers of particles by exploiting statistical regularities. When combined with quantum mechanics, it helps physicists to understand some of the most fascinating phenomena in the universe. This course is an introduction to the essential concepts of the subject.  Pre-requisites: Thermal Physics.  Physics Lab 4 (semester 5) Designed to accompany the two theory courses Quantum Mechanics and Statistical Mechanics; this laboratory course explor es their experimental foundations. Students will be introduced to some of the experiments which require Quantum Mechanics in order to be explained, notably discrete atomic spectra and the Zeeman Effect. The lab will also contain experiments on Brownian Mot ion and the determination of other properties of matter like magnetic susceptibility.  Pre-requisites: Physics Lab I.  The Physics of Matter (semester 6 ) In real physical systems the various areas of fundamental physics that are studied separately in pre vious semesters are usually required all at once. The purpose of this course is to show how fundamental physics can be used to study a number of interesting phenomena.  Pre-requisites: All mandatory courses in the physics -major sequence.     9 Elective Physics Courses  Elective courses (for the 3rd and 4th year) are listed below.

FAQs      20         2 Introduction Physics is a doorway to some of the most beautiful and profound phenomena in the universe like black holes, supernovae, Bose -Einstein condensates, superconductors. It is, simultaneously, a driver of lifestyle -changing technology, e.g., engines, electricity, and transistors; and a powerful way of perceiving and analyzing problems that can be applied in various domains, both within and outside standard physics. The beauty and profundity of the phenomena studied by physicists offer romance and excite passion, and the utility of its discoveries and th e power of its methods arouse interest.  These methods can be very intricate and demanding: theoretical physics requires a skilful combination of physical and mathematical thinking, and experimental physics requires in addition the ability to turn tentati ve ideas into physical devices that can put those ideas to the test. As a result, the successful practice of physics demands rigour, flexibility, mechanical adroitness, persistence, and great imagination. The physicist’s imagination is nourished not just b y physics but also by other areas of human enquiry and thought, of the kind that an Ashoka undergraduate is expected to encounter.  With all of this in mind, the physics programme has been designed to: (i) allow students wishing to major in physics to discov er real physics and make a wise choice, in the first year; (ii) provide, throughout, a thorough training in fundamental physics; (iii) bring together everything learnt earlier, and give students the option to pursue more advanced courses in physics or branch out into other areas, in the third year. The idea is to accompany those wishing to become professional physicists as they take the f irst steps in that direction, and to introduce everyone who goes through the programme to the physicist’s way of thinking.     3 Physics Major – Typical Trajectory Semester 2: Discovering UG -level Physics A student wishing to major, minor, or pursue a concentration in Physics is expected to take the introductory course in calculus (Calculus I) offered by the Mathematics Department. Students wishing to major in Physics should plan to take it in their first s emester.  Requirement for Physics major : 13 core physics courses + 2 electives (60 credits)  The physics -major sequence begins in semester 2, with two courses, one in theoretical physics and the other in experimental physics. The first purpose of these c ourses is to provide an experience of UG level physics on the basis of which a student can decide whether or not to major in physics, i.e., they are gateway courses. The second purpose of these courses is to serve as an introduction to the physicist’s way of thinking about problems and solving them, something that has proved useful not just to physicists but also to those in other disciplines that make use of quantitative methods and experiments, e.g., mathematics, computer science, economics, psychology, a nd biology.  Semester 3, 4 and 5: The Physics Core  The physics courses in these 3 semesters form the core of the physicist’s undergraduate canon. Anyone majoring in physics is expected to be thorough in these areas. Each semester has 2 -3 theory courses and an accompanying lab.  Semester 6: Exploring more advanced options  The student can opt for elective courses: each student majoring in physics is required to take at least two. From the student’s point of view, the electives chosen is likely to indicate a post -graduate direction – towards theoretical physics, towards experimental physics or perhaps away from physics into an allied discipline that would benefit from training in physics.        4 Physics Minor or Concentration  To Minor in physics a student must do six courses in physics (24 credits). Of these the two gateway courses – MP1 and Lab 1 – are compulsory. At least two more courses should be taken from among the core courses offered in semesters 3, 4, and 5, provided a ppropriate prerequisites have been satisfied for these courses (recommended courses: Classical Mechanics and Thermal Physics).  The remaining two may be either other compulsory or elective courses offered by the Physics Department or cross -listed with Phy sics, provided appropriate prerequisites have been satisfied. In place of one elective course, a student may take an Independent Study Module (ISM) of equivalent credit.  For a Concentration in physics a student must do six courses in physics (16 credits ). Of these the two gateway courses – MP1 and Lab 1 – are compulsory.  At least two more courses should be taken from among the core courses offered in semesters 3, 4, and 5, provided appropriate prerequisites have been satisfied for these courses (recomm ended courses: Classical Mechanics and Thermal Physics)          5 General Information on the Physics Courses Mathematical level — All theory courses are calculus -based. The level of mathematical sophistication will increase progressively. The mathematical - physics courses will be application -oriented rather than proof -oriented. Familiarity with +2 level physics and mathematics is a ssumed.  Labs — All lab courses will involve extensive use of instruments to make observations. These experiments will in general illustrate ideas studied in the accompanying theory courses.  The use of computers — Many theory courses will include computa tional exercises, generally using the programming language Python. Labs will also require the use of computers.  Duration — Theory courses: two lectures a week each lasting 1.5 hours. In addition, there may be a 1.5 -hour tutorial per week . Laboratory: one 3 -hour main lab session per week and one 3 -hour extra session per week for lab course.  List of Physics Courses Compulsory/Core Courses Mathematical Physics 1 (Gateway course: semester 2) This course aims to familiarise the student with a variety of mathematical techniques which every student of physics should be conversant with. Having taken the course, you should be comfortable with casting a wide variety of physics problems in mathematical language and being able to analyse and solve them subsequently. The course will also include an introduction to programming with Python. Within the physics curriculu m at Ashoka university, this course is an essential prerequisite for Classical Mechanics and Electricity and Magnetism in Light of Relativity offered in the third semester.  Pre-requisites: Students who have not done mathematics at the 12th -grade level are required to take Calculus I.     6 Physics Lab 1 (Gateway course: semester 2) An introduction to physics through experiments. The goal of this introductory lab is to help students develop the skills needed for experimental physics.

Pre-requis ites: none.  Classical Mechanics (semester 3) Newtonian mechanics and an introduction to Lagrangian and Hamiltonian mechanics. Newtonian mechanics is, both historically and otherwise, the starting point of all of physics. The Lagrangian and Hamiltonian formulations of classical mechanics allow a more profound vision of the subject while also introducing the language in which much of higher -level theoretical physics is expressed.  Pre-requisites: MP1  Electricity & Magnetism in Light of Relativity (semester 3 ) The beautiful theory of electricity and magnetism is, with classical mechanics, the heart of c lassical physics. What is often not appreciated at the undergraduate level is that electricity and magnetism are related in a way that reveals the structure of space -time. In this course relativity will be used from the beginning to relate electric and mag netic fields, so that their unity, as components of the electromagnetic field are revealed and used in the study of Maxwell’s Equations.  Pre-requisites: MP1  Physics Lab 2 (semester 3) Designed to accompany the theory courses Classical Mechanics and Ele ctricity & Magnetism in Light of Relativity, this laboratory course explores their experimental foundations. Students will be introduced to video -analysis and modelling to study elastic and inelastic collisions, uniformly accelerated motion, and terminal v elocity.

Pre-requisites: Physics Lab 1      7 Mathematical Physics 2 (semester 4 ) This mathematical physics course aims to be an introduction to differential equations. Besides standard topics in ordinary and partial differential equations, nonlinear dynamical systems will be studied and nonlinear ODEs will be analysed using geometric a nd computational tools. Fourier series will also be studied.  Pre-requisites: MP1  Thermal Physics (semester 4) An Integrated Approach to Thermodynamics and Kinetic Theory. There are three approaches to study systems with large numbers of atoms and molec ules, which exhibit properties like temperature and entropy: kinetic theory, classical thermodynamics, and statistical mechanics. In this course, these three approaches will be taught in an integrated fashion.  Pre-requisites: Mathematical Physics 1.  Oscillations, Waves, and Optics (semester 4) Oscillatory phenomena appear in all areas of physics, both classical and quantum (to the point where a famous textbook begins by saying that the domain of physics is all phenomena that can be reduced to coupled oscillators). The methods used to study oscillatory motion are powerful and wide -ranging in their utility.  Pre-requisites: MP1, Classical Mechanics and Electricity & Magnetism.  Physics Lab 3 (semester 4) Designed to accompany the theory courses Therma l Physics and Oscillations, Waves & Optics, this laboratory course explores their experimental foundations. Students will be introduced to the properties of light as a wave: interference, diffraction, and polarisation, through conceptually rich experiments like the Michelson Interferometer. In addition, mechanical systems which exhibit oscillatory behaviour, like coupled pendula and capillary waves, will also be studied. Students will also be introduced to ideas of thermometry and calibration.  Pre-requisi tes: Physics Lab I.        8 Quantum Mechanics (semester 5) This course is an introduction to Quantum Mechanics (QM). Starting with a historical introduction and motivation, it goes on to introduce probability amplitudes as the fundamental physical basis for QM. Using the Dirac bra -ket notation, the fundamental postulates are then introduced and their consequences worked out. The basic physical concepts are illustrated through spin -½ systems and one -dimensional wave mechanics. Symmetries and Conservation laws in QM are discussed, an introduction to the basic theory of angular momentum and spin is given, and the course culminates with the first major triumph of QM - a quantum mechanical understanding of the hydrogen atom.  Pre-requisites: Classical Mechanics, M athematical Physics I and II.  Strongly recommended: Linear Algebra (Department of Mathematics).  Statistical Mechanics (semester 5) Statistical mechanics allows one to solve problems involving large numbers of particles by exploiting statistical regularities.

We will begin by formulating the primary concepts: the laws of motion and the dynamical equations as differential equations which need to be integrated to find the solutions of mechanical problems. We will stress the importance of conservation laws not only in the solution of otherwise intractable dynamical problems but also their wider scope beyond Newtonian dynamics. As applications we will deal with central force motion and the harmonic oscillator. Besides their historical importance, these are rich and instructive examples illustrating the basic concepts. The second part of the course deals with Analytical Mechanics: We will make the transition from newtonian to lagrangian dynamics by introducing the notion of generalised co-ordinates. The variational principle is then introduced as a unified way of dealing with diverse physical problems. Lagrange’s equations are re-derived and the transition to the hamiltonian form of dynamics is made thereby introducing the concept of phase space - a notion of special importance in statistical mechanics. Subsequently, the Poisson bracket formulation would be discussed. Throughout we will stress the importance of, and the connections between, symmetry principles and conservation laws. This course would be a stepping stone for later courses in quantum and statistical mechanics. It should also enable you to later study more advanced topics in classical physics like fluid mechanics, non-linear dynamical systems and chaos.

It is a doorway to some of the most beautiful and profound phenomena in the universe, e.g. black holes, supernovae, Bose-Einstein condensates, superconductors. It is a driver of lifestyle-changing technology, e.g. engines, electricity, and transistors. And it is a powerful way of perceiving and analysing problems that can be applied in various domains, both within and outside standard physics. The beauty and profundity of the phenomena studied by physicists offer romance and excite passion; the utility of its discoveries and the power of its methods arouse interest. These methods can be very intricate and demanding: theoretical physics requires a skilful combination of physical and mathematical thinking, and experimental physics requires some of this along with the ability to turn tentative ideas into physical devices that can put those ideas to the test. The successful practice of physics demands mathematical and mechanical adroitness, persistence, and great imagination. Fortunately, the physicist’s imagination is nourished not just by physics but also by other areas of human enquiry and thought, of the kind that an Ashoka undergraduate is expected to encounter. With all of this in mind, the physics programme has been designed to: (i) allow students wishing to major in physics to discover real physics and make a wise choice, in the first two semesters; (ii) provide a thorough training in fundamental physics, in the following three semesters; and (iii) bring together everything learnt earlier, and give students the option to pursue more advanced courses in physics or branch out into other areas, in the final semester. The idea is to accompany those wishing to become professional physicists as they take the first steps in that direction, and to introduce everyone who goes through the programme to the physicist’s way of thinking.\\xa0   Students wishing to major, minor, or pursue a concentration in Physics are expected to take the introductory course in calculus (Calculus I) offered by the Mathematics Department. Students wishing to major in Physics should plan to take it in their first semester. Mathematical level: All theory courses are calculus-based. The level of mathematical sophistication will increase progressively. The mathematical-physics courses will be application-oriented rather than proof-oriented. A student should have studied Mathematics at the +2 level in school. Those who do not have the requisite mathematics training should take the mathematics Foundation Course and the Calculus course as early as possible. Labs: All lab courses will involve extensive use of instruments to make observations. These experiments will in general illustrate ideas studied in the accompanying theory courses. The use of computers: Many theory courses will include computational exercises, generally using the programming language Python. Labs will also require the use of computers. Duration: Theory courses – Two lectures a week each lasting 1.5 hours. Laboratory courses – One 3-hour lab session per week (plus one optional 3-hour lab session for students to complete their work.)    Students wishing to major, minor, or pursue a concentration in Physics are encouraged to take the introductory course in calculus (Calculus I) offered by the Mathematics Department. Students wishing to major in Physics should plan to take it in their first semester. Number of courses required to major in physics: 15. 100 credits (FCs + CCs + Major courses + other courses). Of these, the 13 courses of the core curriculum are mandatory, and 2 electives may be chosen of those offered (only level 3000 or above). Students are of course free to take as many of the electives as they wish.   Students wishing to major, minor, or pursue a concentration in Physics are encouraged to take the introductory course in calculus (Calculus I) offered by the Mathematics Department.\\xa0 Number of courses required to minor in physics: 6 (24 credits). Of these the two gateway courses – Mathematical Physics I: Mathematical and Computational Toolkit and Lab 1: An Introduction to Physics through Experiments – are compulsory. At least two more courses should be taken from among the core courses offered in semesters 3, 4, and 5, provided appropriate prerequisites have been satisfied for these courses (recommended courses: Classical Mechanics and Thermal Physics). The remaining two may be either other compulsory or elective courses offered by the Physics Department or cross-listed with Physics, provided appropriate prerequisites have been satisfied. In place of one elective course, a student may take an Independent Study Module (ISM) of equivalent credit.   The Department of Physics also offers a Minor in Astronomy, the requirement for which is six courses (24 credits). Two of these are core courses (compulsory): \\xa0The Physics of the Universe (theory) and Observing the Cosmos (lab). Four other courses are to be chosen from the following seven electives on offer: Cosmic Messengers – I (theory), Cosmic Messengers – II (lab), The Earth and Other Planets, The Violent Universe, Astrophysical and Geophysical Fluid Dynamics, Introduction to General Relativity with Application to Cosmology, and Computational Astrophysics and Geophysics.   Students wishing to major, minor, or pursue a concentration in Physics are encouraged to take the introductory course in calculus (Calculus I) offered by the Mathematics Department.\\xa0 Number of courses required for a concentration in physics: 4 (16 credits). Of these the two gateway courses – Mathematical Physics I: Mathematical and Computational Toolkit and Lab 1: An Introduction to Physics through Experiments – are compulsory. At least two more courses should be taken from among the core courses offered in semesters 3, 4 and 5, provided appropriate prerequisites have been satisfied for these courses.   Semesters 1 and 2: Discovering College-level Physics: Students wishing to major in physics are expected to take, in the first semester, the introductory course in calculus offered by the Mathematics Department. The physics-major sequence begins in semester 2, with two courses, one in theoretical physics and the other in experimental physics. The first purpose of these courses is to provide an experience of undergraduate-level physics on the basis of which a student can decide whether or not to major in physics, i.e. they are gateway courses. The second purpose of these courses is to serve as an introduction to the physicist’s way of thinking about problems and solving them, something that has proved useful not just to physicists but also to those in other disciplines that make use of quantitative methods and experiments, e.g. mathematics, computer science, economics, psychology, and biology. Semesters 3, 4, and 5: The Physics Core: The physics courses in semesters 3, 4, and 5 form the core of the physicist’s undergraduate canon: Mathematical Physics II, Classical Mechanics, Electricity & Magnetism in Light of Relativity, Thermal & Statistical Physics, Oscillations, Waves & Optics, Quantum Mechanics I, and Statistical Mechanics, and three accompanying labs. Anyone majoring in physics is expected to be thorough in these areas. Semester 6: Choosing a Direction and Bringing Physics Together: In semester 6 there will be a required course, The Physics of Matter, that brings together much of the physics learnt in earlier semesters, so that the student leaves with a view of physics as an integrated subject. In addition there will be two more elective courses.   Probability and Statistics, offered by the Department of Mathematics.      Ashoka University’s Department of Physics offers a methodically crafted undergraduate programme to students. Students get expert guidance to launch a career in Research, Innovation & related fields.     Graduating with a Physics degree at Ashoka helps in improving one’s inquisitive qualities backed with the ability to come up with ideas and experiment on those. The Physics labs are my absolute favourite as they provide students with the freedom to work on the lab experiments with their own methods which helps in a better understanding of the subject and one can see many innovations take place. There definitely were moments where everything seems just too difficult to complete but once you are through, there’s no better a feeling. I feel anyone who has graduated with a Physics degree at Ashoka may not remember every formula, every equation for the rest of their lives but it gives them the confidence to take on anything that comes ahead no matter how difficult it may seem. Anand Waghmare ASP 2021        The gateway courses (Mathematical and Computational Toolkit and Laboratory 1) are the mandatory courses to pursue a physics minor. Apart from these two, the student is expected to take 4 courses of their choice. Of these 4 courses at least two should be taken from among the other core courses. The remaining two can be core or elective courses and one of them can also be an ISM. So, in total a student has to do 6 courses to complete a minor in Physics.   The gateway courses (Mathematical and Computational Toolkit and Laboratory 1) are the mandatory courses to pursue a physics concentration. Apart from these two, the student is expected to take 2 courses of their choice from among the core courses. So, in total a student has to do 4 courses to complete a concentration in Physics.   You can reach out to the Academic Representative of the Department.   The mandatory gateway courses are offered in the spring semesters. Other core courses are spread throughout the 6 semesters. All courses are not offered in every semester.\\xa0   The student is expected to have a science/mathematics background in their high school (at +2 level). Calculus is a recommended course to be taken in their first semester.   Yes. They are independent of the theory courses in terms of the number of credits – 4 credits for each theory or lab course.

      "{'metadata': None, 'page_content': 'Chemistry Handbook    GUIDELINES FOR STUDENTS Monsoon 2020   Department of Chemistry              Chemistry at Ashoka  The chemistry curriculum for undergraduate program in Ashoka University in the Monsoon 2020 semester is designed for students at all levels. The students majoring in Chemistry as well as those who are interested or doing minor, both will get benefit from this course. Meticulous understanding of chemistry for any students is the focus of th is syllabus.  Chemistry is involved in everything we do. Even if y ou are not chemist, every time you cook, bake, use the washing powder, toothpaste or taking medicine, you are dealing with chemicals . The study of Chemist ry provides a molecular level of description as well as insights into chemical bonding and give you a perfect picture of bond breaking and forming, overall a reaction. At Ashoka, our objective is to teach Chemistry in an integrative and holistic manner connecting with other branches of science, physics, biology, computer and environmental science . We are constantly trying to correlate with them and bring out the best int erest of our students. We are very hopeful to be an integrated part of Ashoka University in near future.  Further, the chemistry department is building up to do innovative and current research. This semester we have no lab course officially, but students interested to do any chemical reaction studying in theory class are always welcome and perform under the monitoring of professor s. The chemistry research requires to have a very sound knowledge on the basic of chemistry and our target is to build you up as an aspiring researcher through the basic concept of organic, inorganic and physical chemistry in this semester. We are very certain that this knowledge will take you further for any field of science or humanities.   The undergraduate Major in C hemistry  The chemistry major in Ashoka University designed with a belief that the students getting a degree in chemistry can take him/her wherever he/she want s to go, whether it is industry or immediate professional career, or further research in chemistry or intermediate subjects. The chemistry major must complete a total 14 courses to get a graduate degree from Ashoka University. This includes 7 core theory courses and 4 lab courses and any 3 electives. Courses offered by chemistry department or cross -listed with the chemistry department (if any) will also be counted. T he final year students will be offered proposal writing course and can pursue independent research in the department.  The core (theory) courses are:  • Energetics of Change (Semester II) • Basic Inorganic Chemistry (Semester III)  • Concepts in Organic Chemistry (Semester III)  • Atoms, quanta and light (Semester III)  • Inorganic Chemistry (Semester IV)  • Rate, order and mechanism (Semester IV)  • Mechanistic Organic Chemistry (Semester V) • Modern Methods of Analysis and Characterization (Semester V) • Organic Synthesis: Reagents and Synthetic Strategies (Semester VI)  Electives  Electives courses are there to broaden the knowledge of the core courses so that students c an have better understanding of the subjects. There are many courses Ashoka chemistry is offering. A major in chemistry must choose at least 3 electives to graduate.  Suggested Electives • Applied Organometallic & Coordination Chemistry • Environmental Analysis • Chemical Biology • Chemistry of Materials • Renewable Energy: Hydrogen and Solar Energy • Materials at nano scale • Computational Chemistry and Molecular Simulation • Environmental Chemist ry • Energy Materials: Batteries, Super capacitors etc  The undergraduate Minor in Chemistry  Students from different department are always encouraged to take chemistry as their minor. The knowledge will help a student to understand the science in our everyday life. This will also help to become a better researcher in any field of science. We believe it’s a great opportunity for a liberal university student.  To pursue minor in Chemistry at Ashoka, student must take 6 courses. This can include direct course offered from chemistry department or cross -listed (if any) with the department. 4 theory courses and a ny 2 electives can be chosen to complete a minor in Chemistry. Lab courses can be also considered as a minor subject.  Concentration in Chemistry  For taking concentration in Chemistry student must take minimum 4 courses and any 1 elective. In this case also lab course will be considered as a concentration subject.   Prerequisite  The professors require a minimum knowledge of a student for a course . It will be always mentioned in the webpage of chemistry about the prerequisite or students can directly ask the professors. For any introductory theory or lab course and any basic chemistry course no prerequisite requires. For example, ‘introductory labo ratory course’ (1401 -1) demands no prerequisite. For 1000/2000 level courses like ‘Chemistry for life’ no prerequisite needed, anybody can participate. Students from Physics, Biology and Environmental Science can take physical chemistry / theoretical chemis try, chemical biology and environmental chemistry course after discussing with the respective professors without any prerequisite .  The tentative prerequisites are mentioned in the bracket (it may change according to professor demand) . These are all 3000 level courses  • Basic Inorganic Chemistry: Theory Course (None) • Concepts in Organic Chemistry: Theory Course (None) • Atoms, quanta and light: Theory Course (None) • Inorganic Chemistry: Theory Course (Basic Inorganic Chemistry) • Rate, order and mechanism: Theory Course (None) • General Chemistry Laboratory: Lab course (Introductory Laboratory Course) • Mechanistic Organic Chemistry: Theory Course (Concept in Organic Chemistry) • Modern Methods of Analysis and Characterization: Theory Course (None) • General Chemistry Laboratory: Lab Course (Introductory Laboratory Course) • Organic Synthesis: Reagents and Synthetic Strategies (Concept in Organic Chemistry)/ (Mechanistic Organic Chemistry) • Applied Organometallic & Coordination Chemistry (Basic In organic Chemistry/ Inorganic Chemistry) • Environmental Analysis (Concept in Organic Chemistry/ Basic Inorganic Chemistry) • Chemical Biology (Basic Inorganic Chemistry/ Concept in Organic Chemistry/ Introduction to Cell & Molecular Biology/ Chemical Basis of Life/ Biochemistry / Biology major ) • Chemistry of Materials (Basic Inorganic Chemistry/ Atoms, Quanta, & Light) • Renewable Energy: Hydrogen and Solar Energy (Basic Inorganic Chemistry/ Concept in Organic Chemistry/ Atoms, Quanta, & Light) • Materials at nano scale (Basic Inorganic Chemistry/ Atoms, Quanta, & Light) • Computational Chemistry and Molecular Simulation (Atoms, Quanta, & Light / Physics major ) • Environm ental Chemistry (Basic Inorganic Chemistry/ Concept in Organic Chemistry / Environmental science major ) • Energy Materials: Batteries, Super capacitors etc (Basic Inorganic Chemistry/ Concept in Organic Chemistry/ Atoms, Quanta, & Light)   Frequently asked questions  If you have any other questions, you can write to your first Point of Contact, the Chemistry Student Representative, Isha Singhal at isha.singhal_ug22@ashoka.edu.in ; or direct your queries to the - Head, Department of Chemistry , Professor Sour av Pal at sourav.pal@ashoka.edu.in - UG Program Coordinator, Department of Chemistry, Dr. Munmun Ghosh at munmun.ghosh@ashoka.edu.in  1.

      "{'metadata': None, 'page_content': 'Chemistry Handbook    GUIDELINES FOR STUDENTS Monsoon 2020   Department of Chemistry              Chemistry at Ashoka  The chemistry curriculum for undergraduate program in Ashoka University in the Monsoon 2020 semester is designed for students at all levels. The students majoring in Chemistry as well as those who are interested or doing minor, both will get benefit from this course. Meticulous understanding of chemistry for any students is the focus of th is syllabus.  Chemistry is involved in everything we do. Even if y ou are not chemist, every time you cook, bake, use the washing powder, toothpaste or taking medicine, you are dealing with chemicals . The study of Chemist ry provides a molecular level of description as well as insights into chemical bonding and give you a perfect picture of bond breaking and forming, overall a reaction. At Ashoka, our objective is to teach Chemistry in an integrative and holistic manner connecting with other branches of science, physics, biology, computer and environmental science . We are constantly trying to correlate with them and bring out the best int erest of our students. We are very hopeful to be an integrated part of Ashoka University in near future.  Further, the chemistry department is building up to do innovative and current research. This semester we have no lab course officially, but students interested to do any chemical reaction studying in theory class are always welcome and perform under the monitoring of professor s. The chemistry research requires to have a very sound knowledge on the basic of chemistry and our target is to build you up as an aspiring researcher through the basic concept of organic, inorganic and physical chemistry in this semester. We are very certain that this knowledge will take you further for any field of science or humanities.   The undergraduate Major in C hemistry  The chemistry major in Ashoka University designed with a belief that the students getting a degree in chemistry can take him/her wherever he/she want s to go, whether it is industry or immediate professional career, or further research in chemistry or intermediate subjects. The chemistry major must complete a total 14 courses to get a graduate degree from Ashoka University. This includes 7 core theory courses and 4 lab courses and any 3 electives. Courses offered by chemistry department or cross -listed with the chemistry department (if any) will also be counted. T he final year students will be offered proposal writing course and can pursue independent research in the department.  The core (theory) courses are:  • Energetics of Change (Semester II) • Basic Inorganic Chemistry (Semester III)  • Concepts in Organic Chemistry (Semester III)  • Atoms, quanta and light (Semester III)  • Inorganic Chemistry (Semester IV)  • Rate, order and mechanism (Semester IV)  • Mechanistic Organic Chemistry (Semester V) • Modern Methods of Analysis and Characterization (Semester V) • Organic Synthesis: Reagents and Synthetic Strategies (Semester VI)  Electives  Electives courses are there to broaden the knowledge of the core courses so that students c an have better understanding of the subjects. There are many courses Ashoka chemistry is offering. A major in chemistry must choose at least 3 electives to graduate.  Suggested Electives • Applied Organometallic & Coordination Chemistry • Environmental Analysis • Chemical Biology • Chemistry of Materials • Renewable Energy: Hydrogen and Solar Energy • Materials at nano scale • Computational Chemistry and Molecular Simulation • Environmental Chemist ry • Energy Materials: Batteries, Super capacitors etc  The undergraduate Minor in Chemistry  Students from different department are always encouraged to take chemistry as their minor. The knowledge will help a student to understand the science in our everyday life. This will also help to become a better researcher in any field of science. We believe it’s a great opportunity for a liberal university student.  To pursue minor in Chemistry at Ashoka, student must take 6 courses. This can include direct course offered from chemistry department or cross -listed (if any) with the department. 4 theory courses and a ny 2 electives can be chosen to complete a minor in Chemistry. Lab courses can be also considered as a minor subject.  Concentration in Chemistry  For taking concentration in Chemistry student must take minimum 4 courses and any 1 elective. In this case also lab course will be considered as a concentration subject.   Prerequisite  The professors require a minimum knowledge of a student for a course . It will be always mentioned in the webpage of chemistry about the prerequisite or students can directly ask the professors. For any introductory theory or lab course and any basic chemistry course no prerequisite requires. For example, ‘introductory labo ratory course’ (1401 -1) demands no prerequisite. For 1000/2000 level courses like ‘Chemistry for life’ no prerequisite needed, anybody can participate. Students from Physics, Biology and Environmental Science can take physical chemistry / theoretical chemis try, chemical biology and environmental chemistry course after discussing with the respective professors without any prerequisite .  The tentative prerequisites are mentioned in the bracket (it may change according to professor demand) . These are all 3000 level courses  • Basic Inorganic Chemistry: Theory Course (None) • Concepts in Organic Chemistry: Theory Course (None) • Atoms, quanta and light: Theory Course (None) • Inorganic Chemistry: Theory Course (Basic Inorganic Chemistry) • Rate, order and mechanism: Theory Course (None) • General Chemistry Laboratory: Lab course (Introductory Laboratory Course) • Mechanistic Organic Chemistry: Theory Course (Concept in Organic Chemistry) • Modern Methods of Analysis and Characterization: Theory Course (None) • General Chemistry Laboratory: Lab Course (Introductory Laboratory Course) • Organic Synthesis: Reagents and Synthetic Strategies (Concept in Organic Chemistry)/ (Mechanistic Organic Chemistry) • Applied Organometallic & Coordination Chemistry (Basic In organic Chemistry/ Inorganic Chemistry) • Environmental Analysis (Concept in Organic Chemistry/ Basic Inorganic Chemistry) • Chemical Biology (Basic Inorganic Chemistry/ Concept in Organic Chemistry/ Introduction to Cell & Molecular Biology/ Chemical Basis of Life/ Biochemistry / Biology major ) • Chemistry of Materials (Basic Inorganic Chemistry/ Atoms, Quanta, & Light) • Renewable Energy: Hydrogen and Solar Energy (Basic Inorganic Chemistry/ Concept in Organic Chemistry/ Atoms, Quanta, & Light) • Materials at nano scale (Basic Inorganic Chemistry/ Atoms, Quanta, & Light) • Computational Chemistry and Molecular Simulation (Atoms, Quanta, & Light / Physics major ) • Environm ental Chemistry (Basic Inorganic Chemistry/ Concept in Organic Chemistry / Environmental science major ) • Energy Materials: Batteries, Super capacitors etc (Basic Inorganic Chemistry/ Concept in Organic Chemistry/ Atoms, Quanta, & Light)   Frequently asked questions  If you have any other questions, you can write to your first Point of Contact, the Chemistry Student Representative, Isha Singhal at isha.singhal_ug22@ashoka.edu.in ; or direct your queries to the - Head, Department of Chemistry , Professor Sour av Pal at sourav.pal@ashoka.edu.in - UG Program Coordinator, Department of Chemistry, Dr. Munmun Ghosh at munmun.ghosh@ashoka.edu.in  1.

Observations tell us that the universe is neither eternal nor static, and therefore it raises questions as to when and how did the universe start? What did it look like in the past? How will it evolve in the future? Aim of this course is to use all the physics that you have learned as an undergraduate to try and answer these questions. The student will have a fairly deep understanding the origin and evolution of the universe, and will be exposed to outstanding unsolved problems.

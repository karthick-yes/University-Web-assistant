    "# RAG Implementation Comparison: Custom vs. LangChain\n",
    "\n",
    "## Overview\n",
    "\n",
    "In this notebook, I've implemented two versions of Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG):\n",
    "\n",
    "1. A custom implementation built from scratch\n",
    "2. An implementation using LangChain\n",
    "\n",
    "## Key Findings\n",
    "\n",
    "### Custom Implementation\n",
    "- Built entirely from scratch\n",
    "- Offers more control over the process\n",
    "- Resulted in a more manageable size for Lambda deployment\n",
    "\n",
    "### LangChain Implementation\n",
    "- Utilized the LangChain library for RAG\n",
    "- Provided pre-built components and easier setup\n",
    "- Resulted in significantly larger deployment size\n",
    "\n",
    "## Deployment Challenges\n",
    "\n",
    "When attempting to deploy these implementations to AWS Lambda, I encountered notable differences:\n",
    "\n",
    "- **Custom Implementation**: Successfully deployed within Lambda's size limits\n",
    "- **LangChain Implementation**: Faced size-related errors during deployment\n",
    "\n",
    "### Note on Multiple Layers\n",
    "While I'm aware of the possibility of using multiple layers in Lambda to accommodate larger dependencies, this approach provided minimal improvements for the LangChain implementation. The size reduction was not significant enough to justify the added complexity of managing multiple layers.\n",
    "\n",
    "## Conclusion\n",
    "\n",
    "For my use case, the custom RAG implementation proved more suitable for Lambda deployment due to its smaller size footprint. While LangChain offers convenience and pre-built components, its size makes it challenging to deploy in serverless environments like Lambda without significant compromises.\n",
    "\n",
    "The trade-off between development ease (LangChain) and deployment simplicity (custom implementation) is evident. For Lambda-based deployments, the custom approach appears to be more practical and cost-effective in the long run."

      "        In general, students should clear as many Fundamental and Core Domain courses before going for a summer or semester abroad. For courses taken at host institutions abroad to count towards their Psychology degree at Ashoka, students must fill a credit transfer form stating the courses they plan to take at the host institution and send this along with the detailed course syllabi and course timings to the HoD, copying the professors who offer the equivalent course at Ashoka. Ashoka University matches the number of transfer credits with the number of contact hours, subjected to OAA’s regulations for the maximum number of credits allowed to be transferred throughout a student’s candidature. A typical course at Ashoka is 4 credits (13 weeks x 3 hrs = 39 contact hours). The final decision on whether credits amassed at a summer/semester institution can be transferred to your degree requirements at Ashoka will be of the HoD. Students should follow this protocol and read the frequently asked questions here first before seeking advice from the Program Coordinator during their planning stages.\n"

These programmes are designed\\xa0 to acquaint a student with literature and literary methods across genres, cultures, and languages. Students master interpretation and analysis skills, learning to formulate robust and original arguments both in writing and speaking.   Students can pursue a pure English major or one of many interdisciplinary English majors; they can also pursue a minor or a concentration in English. The department offers a wide selection of courses, which are divided into 4 categories: 1. 1000-levels: These are general English courses that any student at Ashoka can take. They also count as electives for students majoring or minoring in English. 2. 2000-levels:\\xa0These courses are introductory courses to various fields and methodologies of literary study. Although they are aimed at English students specifically, they can be taken by all Ashoka students. 3. 3000-levels: These courses are specialist courses designed for English majors and minors. Only students who have taken the gateways can take these courses. 4. 4000-levels: The 4000-level Graduate Seminars are reserved for ASP, MA, MLS students (with an English concentration), and PhD students. With the permission of the instructor, a third-year student can take a maximum of one 4000-level course towards their major.    The pure major in English offers students an in-depth, expansive study of literature: courses cover a diverse range of texts from across the world, thinking through classic and unusual questions and themes. Students are expected to take 12 courses to earn their major in English. Of these, the course break-up is as follows: 2 Gateways Forms of Literature Introduction to Literary Theory 4 Survey Courses Early British Literature Indian Literatures Literature in the Age of Empire Postcolonial Literature 6 Electives: 1 Critical Thinking Seminar* 1 1000/2000-level courses** 3 3000-level courses 1 1000/2000/3000-level elective Up to 3 cross-listed courses from another department can count towards the major. *The Critical Thinking Seminar is a mandatory requirement for batches from the incoming Undergraduate Batch of 2023. Previous batches can count a CTS towards their requirements, but they are not required to do so. Instead, they can fulfill their requirements by taking another 1000/2000-level elective. **English majors can take a maximum of ONE approved language course in an approved language (Sanskrit, Persian, Greek, Latin, Old English) instead of one of their required 1000/2000-level electives. Ideally, an English major’s timetable—solely with regard to their English requirements (excluding any FC, CT and CC requirements)—should look like this:   Semester 1 Semester 2 Semester 3 Semester 4 Semester 5 Semester 6  Forms of Literature Literary Theory \\xa0 Early British Literature Literature in the Age of Empire Indian\\xa0 \\xa0 \\xa0 \\xa0 \\xa0 \\xa0 Literatures Postcolonial Literatures  6 electives, distributed as per the student’s preference  While sticking to this timetable is encouraged for the sake of better management and smooth completion of an English degree, Ashoka’s flexible academic structure ensures alternate organizations. Ultimately, it is up to the students how they wish to engineer their academic years. The overall credit requirement to graduate with an English major is 100 credits. These come from the English courses, FCs, ICT, CCs, and other courses.   The minor in English offers a thorough grounding in core literature courses, while granting students the opportunity to pursue fields of their own interest. To complete a minor in English, a student must do 6 courses: 2 Gateways Forms of Literature Introduction to Literary Theory 2 of 4 Survey Courses Early British Literature Indian Literatures Literature in the Age of Empire Postcolonial Literature 2 Electives: 1 1000/2000-level elective 1 3000-level elective Up to 2 cross-listed courses from another department can count towards the minor. Postcolonial Literatures, although a 3000-level survey course, will not count towards fulfilling the three 3000-level elective requirements.   The English department at Ashoka offers three interdisciplinary majors: English and Creative Writing, English and Media Studies, and English and Performing Arts. Students are required to take 16 courses across both the disciplines to earn their interdisciplinary major. Along with their discipline specific courses, students need to take their required FCs, ICT, CCs and other courses to fulfill their overall credit requirement of 116 credits to graduate with an interdisciplinary major.   The concentration in English is for students who are invested in exploring limited, but varied, English courses. To complete a concentration in English, a student must do 4 courses: 1 of 2 Gateway Courses:\\xa0Forms of Literature or Introduction to Literary Theory Any 3 English courses These 3 courses can include one of the other gateways, any of the survey courses, and the electives. However, students can only take 3000-level electives if they have taken Introduction to Literary Theory. Up to 1 cross-listed course from another department can count towards the concentration.    Department of English Handbook      Ashoka University’s Department of English offers an assortment of undergraduate programmes which prepare students for careers in Higher Education, Law, Journalism, Advertising and related fields. Students are exposed to different ways of thinking about literature and media, social and philosophical concepts and more.

It introduces English students to literary history as articulated through different genres: the epic, the tale, the novel, lyric, drama, and the short story. Rather than regarding literary forms as fixed categories with specific rules, we will instead examine them as dynamically shaped by, and in conversation with, their social and historical contexts. We will consider how these forms have meant different things at different times, both to understand the transformations of literature and the changing meanings of genre itself.We will look at the epic and how its world view has transformed from Gilgamesh to John Milton’s Paradise Lost; tales and how their preoccupations have changed from Geoffrey Chaucer’s Canterbury Tales to T.S. Eliot’s The Waste Land; novels and how their social function and meaning vary from Joseph Conrad’s Heart of Darkness to Amruta Patil’s Kari; lyric poetry and how its modes of intimacy have transformed from William Shakespeare’s Sonnets to Audre Lorde’s poetry; drama and how its representation of gender has morphed from Aristophanes’ Lysistrata to Caryl Churchill’s Top Girls; and short stories and how their uncanny imaginative scope has been reconfigured from E. T. A. Hoffman to Saadat Hasan Manto. We will also read some theories of literature and literary transformation, including essays by Karl Marx, Mikhail Bakhtin, T. S. Eliot, Bertolt Brecht, and Sigmund Freud.

Our coursework allows for exposure to a wide array of texts, theories and disciplinary formations from around the world. MA students will also have the opportunity to pursue courses in other departments at Ashoka thus bringing new lenses to bear on literary studies. Above all, students will pursue their study of literature in relation to the larger world they live in and ask pertinent questions of it.\\xa0 The MA English programme places a premium equally on rigorous critical thinking and in-depth research. This emphasis on rigour, alongside the other avenues for intellectual, professional and personal growth offered by Ashoka University, will better prepare students for a variety of career paths, including further study leading to a Ph.D., teaching at the high-school level, advertising, media, and law.\\xa0     The MA in English is a two-year, four-semester programme. Students take a mixture of required courses, elective courses, Independent Study Modules, and electives from other programmes. Within the programme, students have the option of pursuing a concentration, and specializing in a particular field. They are also free to follow a general path of literary studies and can choose not to have a concentration. Students who choose to pursue a concentration are required to take a minimum of two electives as well as write a thesis in their field of specialization. Should students select a concentration, it is required that they do so by the beginning of the third semester, so that they are able to take a minimum of two electives in their chosen subfields before writing their theses. Additionally, each student must choose their thesis advisor by the beginning of the third semester. This should be the professor with whom the student feels most compatible both intellectually and personally.   Students are required to graduate with a total of 48 credits. These are distributed over four semesters with 12 credits per semester. Each course carries 4 credits, and the final semester thesis will carry 8 credits. MA students cannot register for more than three courses per semester. Students are thus expected to take 10 courses while they complete their thesis. Of these 10 courses, 4 are required courses and the other 6 are electives. 4 Required Courses: Seminar in Literary Theory: This course will focus on the study of various schools of literary theory. The course seeks to examine the bigger questions of literature—ranging from the ways in which texts can engage with various issues to an understanding of how we make meaning—by examining how various theorists address them. Seminar in Writing and Research Methodology: This course aims to provide clues to read, interpret and write academically.\\xa0 The aim of the course is to expose students to methods of gleaning arguments, writing abstracts; identifying archives; learning citation styles; and familiarising them with a range of research methods. Graduate Pro-Seminar: Thesis Preparation: The graduate pro-seminar is a two-semester sequence. In the first semester, students will have the opportunity to familiarise themselves with the methodological foundations of thesis writing by engaging with research-active faculty and their writing, learning directly from scholars in the field. Graduate Pro-Seminar: Thesis Writing: In the second semester of the graduate pro-seminar, students will workshop their thesis drafts through a series of round tables and conference-style panel presentations, culminating in an academic symposium at which they will present their thesis projects to a larger audience. 8 Electives: Apart from the required courses, students are free to take 8 elective courses that cater to their individual interests. As the programme encourages interdisciplinarity, students are allowed to take one of these 8 electives from another Department across their two years of study. The other 7 electives must be taken from the electives offered by the English and Creative Writing department. At least two of these electives must cover periods before 1800. If students have an area of interest that has not been explored by any of the offered electives, they may also approach faculty to propose the possible creation of an Independent Study Module (ISM) that focuses on the subject in question. The availability of ISMs will depend on the consent of the faculty advisor. Students can take up to a maximum of one ISM on a topic of their devising.

South Asian Literature (SAL) This concentration adopts a comparative approach to the study of textual and popular cultural traditions of South Asia (India, Pakistan, Sri Lanka, Bangladesh, Afghanistan and Nepal). In working towards this concentration, students develop an understanding of South Asia as a ‘region’ by exploring its overlapping and divergent religious and political contexts of the self and the community. Courses might include (but are not limited to): Partition Literature, Scripting Caste, Women Writers from South Asia, Violence and South Asian Literatures, Indian Literatures in Translation, Sufi Poetry, Bollywood and the Ideas of India. Global and Indian Shakespeares (GIS) Shakespeare’s work has been reimagined all over the world in a variety of media.\\xa0 His plays have been reconceived with extraordinary frequency across the Indian subcontinent, in theatre, literature and especially film, often tackling issues such as gender, colonialism, caste, communal violence, and partition.\\xa0 Students in this concentration are invited to hone their critical and creative skills by producing their own locally grounded reimaginings. Courses might include (but are not limited to): Masala Shakespeare, Shakespeare and the World, Spectres of Hamlet, Shakesqueer, Adapting Shakespeare: Writing and Performance Workshop. Gender and Sexuality Studies (GSS) This track will focus on the importance of gender and sexuality in literature as well as in our everyday lives. Rather than following the trajectory of\\xa0 “women” or “homosexuals” as categories, we will put pressure on the assumptions undergirding these categories in the first place. Students will be taught to ground their thinking of literature and the world in wider theoretical frameworks related to queer and feminist thought. Courses might include (but are not limited to): Reading the Body Politic, A History of Desire in India, Shakesqueer, South Asian Literature and Gender, Desiring Film, Women’s Writing, Victorian Fetishes, The Law of Desire, Bollywood and Gender, Dalit Literature. Modern Literature and Culture (MLC) This track of study explores the question of modernity and its aftermath, ranging from the Enlightenment era to the present. Areas of focus include 18th, 19th and 20th century literature and culture, modernisms including vernacular modernisms in literature and cinema, postmodernism, postcolonial literatures, law and literature, ecocriticism and discourse analysis. Courses might include (but are not limited to): Epic Histories, Privacy, Neoliberalism, Trauma and Disaster, Children’s Literature, Cinema and Violence, Acts of Faith, ‘Romanticism, History, Prophecy’, American Outlaws, Conspiracy Fiction, Conquests of Nature, Climate Fiction, Reading Theory, The Law of Desire, Victorian Fetishes, Making Space, Loss and Longing, Literature and the Age of Empire, Postcolonial Literature, The Rhetoric of Social Protest, Critical Race Theory. \\xa0Global Medieval Studies (GM) The Global Medieval Studies concentration takes a comparativist approach to the cultures of the various medieval periods in world history, particularly in Europe and South Asia, while encouraging students to think critically about periodic nomenclatures. The track encourages students to think about the medieval not simply as a historical field, but also as a conceptual category that is critical to our constructions of antiquity and modernity. This concentration brings medieval works from different cultures into conversation while also encouraging the interdisciplinary study of literature, art and architecture, music, science, religion and philosophy. Courses might include (but are not limited to): Global Medieval Women Writers, Comparative Medieval Mysticism, Global Medievalisms, Utopia in the Middle Ages, Medieval Travel Writing, History of Medieval Medicine, University Cultures. Creative Writing (CW) The Creative Writing track combines literary study with creative practice. Along with courses in the academic study of literature, students also take workshop courses and write a thesis in the genre of their choice: original prose, poetry, and translation, including multi-genre work. Courses might include (but are not limited to): Poetry Workshop, Fiction Workshop, Translation Workshop, Publishing Seminar. \\xa0    MA English Handbook      The Master of Arts (MA) programme in English at Ashoka University aims to occupy an important space in the current landscape of higher education in India. Many young scholars of literature and culture in India are contemplating studying these subjects at the Ph.D. level, but have yet to be exposed to the liberal arts ethos and pedagogy. The MA programme in English will provide a unique intellectual experience for these students while carving out a much-needed path to higher studies abroad and in India.

When studying literature, we often seek out ways of uncovering the workings—and play—of these engagements in the texts we read. This course turns to the questions and answers posed by theory itself, rather than applications through the reading of literary texts. Theory can seem complex and intimidating, but its questions are fundamental: how do we make meaning? How do we constitute texts, and how do texts constitute us? How are we to know those parts of ourselves that refuse knowledge? How do our bodies, our given identities, and the material conditions of our lives shape who we are and how we feel, think, act, desire, and read?

When studying literature, we often seek out ways of uncovering the workings—and play—of these engagements in the texts we read. This course turns to the questions and answers posed by theory itself, rather than applications through the reading of literary texts. Theory can seem complex and intimidating, but its questions are fundamental: how do we make meaning? How do we constitute texts, and how do texts constitute us? How are we to know those parts of ourselves that refuse knowledge? How do our bodies, our given identities, and the material conditions of our lives shape who we are and how we feel, think, act, desire, and read? Keeping these and other basic questions in mind, this course will survey the key approaches and texts of contemporary literary theory.

What counts as literature? What is the role of history in the production of literature? Does literature reflect reality or create it? Does gender play a role in the kind of literature we read and write? Why do we desire to read? What do we read when we read? In this class we will be working in theory’s self-reflexive spirit: reading and writing about texts that think about reading and writing. Even though its antecedents stretch as far back as Plato, we will be focusing primarily on several schools of literary thought from the 19th century to the present. The premise in all these theories is that literature is not a transparent medium; rather, we need to work hard in order to read, think, and write.

For civil and congenial participation in the campus residence life experience, students are expected to familiarise themselves and abide by this policy. Any violation of this policy will result in a disciplinary infraction with a consequent course of action as decided by the appropriate University committee.      Room and Roommate Assignment A. Room Allocation At the beginning of the academic year, room allotment is made on a twin-sharing basis for the entire academic year as per the building-level assignments approved by the University. For emergency preparedness, the University needs to know the room assignment of each student living in campus housing. Students therefore may not change rooms or roommates without official authorisation. Note: Students who are not enrolled in any academic courses will not be allotted a room within the University housing. B. Disability related Accommodations Students are expected to self-identify any specific disability-related needs and raise their requests via email with the Office of Learning Support (OLS) at ols@ashoka.edu.in to avail housing accommodations prior to the start of the academic year. Incoming students may reach out to the Office of Admissions first while returning students (who have a newly-diagnosed condition or a change to a previously documented condition) can register directly with OLS. Students are required to provide comprehensive professional documentation of their disability to the Office of Learning Support. OLS will then assess and recommend housing accommodations (such as location, lights, washroom accessibility, ergonomic furniture etc.) to the Residence Life Office. The student must be willing to live in any Residence Hall and/or room that is determined to meet their disability/medical need by the University. All such accommodations will be made on a space-available basis and only for the concerned individual – not for a group. C. Room Reassignment Both occupants may request a room change for non-functioning room facilities or any other difficult room experience related to the infrastructure. In all such situations, the concerned students should meet with their respective Warden for appropriate assistance. Once the Warden confirms the validity of the request made, they may recommend a room change for the occupants in consultation with the senior member(s) of the Residence Life Office. If the room change request is approved, the Residence Life Office will make an offer regarding the feasible arrangement. After the offer is made, the student will have 24 hours to decline or accept the offer. If the offer is accepted, the students will have 48 hours to move into the newly assigned room and return the keys for the previous assignment. If the students do not respond to the offer within the stipulated duration of 24 hours, the offer will be withdrawn by the Residence Life Office. Reassignments for special circumstances, such as a recommendation from the Office of Learning Support (OLS), serious facility-related problems that can be a potential life hazard etc., will be given the highest priority. Important: Residence Life Office reserves the right to reassign any room if deemed necessary during the academic year. D. Resident Rights As a stressful living environment can affect a student’s academic performance and emotional well-being, Ashoka University is committed to ensuring that certain basic rights and duties are binding upon all students. These are – 1. The right to privacy 2. The right to free and uninhibited access to the allotted room at all times 3. The right to have the roommate and/or peers respect personal belongings 4. The right to study and sleep peacefully in the allotted room, free from any undue interference or hindrance from the roommate and/or peers 5. The right to be asked/consulted with and to grant/deny permission for having\\xa0 peers invited over in the allotted room 6. The right to a hygienic and clean living environment 7. The right to free and uninhibited access to common spaces at all times 8. The right to be treated as equal without fear of harassment, intimidation, bullying, and physical and/or emotional harm 9. The right to discuss and resolve disagreements or conflicts in a respectful, civil, and open manner Any violation of the above-stated rights can be reported to the concerned authorities for further action. E. Roommate Allocation Roommates are decided by the University with the help of relevant information provided by the students themselves through the Roommate Matching Form for incoming students. Returning students are allowed to choose their preferred roommates by indicating the same in the Roommate Preference Form shared by the Residence Life Office at the beginning of each academic year. All students are expected to room with students from within their own batch. Residential Access A. Keys Students will be issued keys to their allotted room including keys for the wardrobe and desk drawers at the beginning of the academic year. They will be responsible for keeping their keys safe as the University is not liable for losses/damages sustained to personal belongings because they lend their keys to another individual(s). Possession and/or misuse of keys belonging to other students is strictly prohibited and those found in violation will be liable for disciplinary action. Duplication of the keys and/or use of duplicate keys for unauthorised access is a punishable offense and will be reported to the concerned committee. If the key(s) is lost, a replacement key may be issued by the Residence Life Office subject to the availability of the concerned personnel. Any costs incurred for the replacement key will have to be borne by the student. Replacing, exchanging, or otherwise tampering with room/wardrobe door handles and locks is prohibited. If the lock is non-functional, it is expected that the student will reach out to the respective Warden for assistance. Students are required to entrust the Warden with any unattended keys that they chance upon anywhere on campus. Students are not allowed to leave their keys in their room or entrust their keys with their peers at the end of the academic year. They are expected to complete the check-out process, including returning the keys, themselves. B. ID Card Incoming students are issued University 6ID Cards (HID enabled) by the Residence Life Office during the check-in process. Possession and/or misuse of ID cards belonging to other students is strictly prohibited and those found in violation will be liable for disciplinary action. If the ID card is lost, the student should immediately alert the Residence Life Office so that the card can be deactivated to prevent any misuse. A replacement will be issued subject to processing time. The cost incurred for replacing the ID card will have to be borne by the student. Students are required to entrust the Warden with any unattended University ID cards that they chance upon anywhere on campus. Students must carry their University issued ID cards at all times and produce it on demand by the security staff or any other authorised personnel. Failure to produce the ID card on demand may be treated as an act of misconduct if satisfactory reasons are not provided upon further enquiry. During the Exit Clearance process from the University, due to withdrawal from/completion of their academic programme, the students must surrender their ID card back to the Residence Life Office. Residence Support The Residence Life Office is managed through the efforts of a robust team of staff. The descriptions of their position are as below: The Residence Life Office is led and overseen by the Associate Director who is responsible for maintaining discipline alongside, providing pastoral care and support within the Halls of Residence.

Their primary role is to manage the student check-in and check-out process, respond to emergencies and disciplinar infractions, manage building infrastructure, coordinate in-hall housekeeping and maintenance staff, and conduct business necessary to the well-being of the student community. Concerns about Residence Life policies, sources of conflict in the hall, conduct, infractions or building infrastructure should be reported first to the Warden, before reaching out to the Associate Director.      Common Area Conduct Residence Hall balconies must be kept clean and neat at all times. Events and/or group activities are not permitted on Hall balconies without the written approval of the Residence Life Office. Please limit the number of people in such spaces and exercise extreme caution. Please keep washrooms clean after use and if found choked or unclean due to negligence or deliberate action repeatedly, the Housekeeping staff will not be expected to clean these areas and the students on that floor will have to take the responsibility to get it cleaned. The common rooms shall be open to students at all times subject to maintenance schedule and space bookings. The University is not responsible for money lost in vending machines. Students are strictly prohibited from monopolising the common areas. Sleeping in the common rooms and shifting furniture or removing it from a designated area to change the interiors of the common rooms fundamentally is not permitted. Playing games in the hallway, obstructing high-traffic areas (such as doorways, hallways, stairwells) directly and/or through decorations/displays, and all forms of vandalism including but not limited to tampering with emergency signage/response materials (fire extinguishing facilities, exit signs) is strictly prohibited. Upon any damage or loss to University property in common areas including but not limited to the lounge, floors, corridors, washrooms and reading rooms, costs incurred for the purposes of repair or replacement will be billed to the student(s) found responsible. Advertising and publicity materials (i.e. fliers, posters and banners) can be posted only on bulletin boards and only by members of the Ashoka community. All fliers/posters must clearly identify the name of the individual or organization responsible for the content. They should be limited to one per bulletin board and must not block windows, doorways, or walkways.

No one should cover or remove another’s flier, poster or banner. Blackboard/Spray chalking is strictly prohibited on walls of Residences Halls as well as all fixtures and will incur a cleaning fee. Access to non-residential spaces (e.g. attics, mechanical rooms, equipment rooms, roofs) is restricted to authorized university personnel. Quiet Hours In an effort to encourage a comfortable studying and resting environment for all students, Quiet Hours on the entire campus, including the Residence Halls, are to be observed between 01:00 am to 07:00 am every day. During Quiet Hours, students are expected to refrain from playing music or creating loud noise in the Residence Hall rooms, washrooms, hallways etc. Even at all other 7times, students are expected to not cause 8disturbance to other members of the Ashoka community. Construction, renovation, and repair projects (both on and off campus) will necessarily cause increased noise around directly involved and nearby Residence Halls. While all possible measures are taken to minimise the impact of these projects, any student moving into or living in affected areas should be prepared to accept the unavoidable aspects of life on campus under construction and post-construction. Students moving out of the University campus to adjoining village areas and institutions must ensure that they do not create any disturbance that will inconvenience the residents of the neighbourhood. Policies and Regulations Residence Life is governed by various rules and regulations to ensure seamless functioning and harmonious and healthy living conditions for one and all. Listed below is a brief outline of these rules and regulations: Ashoka University Campus – including the Residence Halls – is an alcohol-free, smoke-free and drug-free campus, governed by national, state and university laws and regulations for the same. The University does not permit both check-in and check-out from the campus between the hours of 12:00 AM (midnight) to 6:00 AM. This means that no student is allowed to enter/exit campus after 12:00 AM (midnight) and no student is allowed to enter/exit campus before 6:00 AM. Off-campus visitors will not have access to the Residence Halls. They are allowed to visit students on campus between 8:00 am and 108:00 pm. Parents/Guardians will be permitted to access their ward’s room during moving-in at the time of Orientation and moving out at the end of the academic programme (and on occasions of medical emergencies, with prior knowledge and approval of the respective Warden.) Off-campus students are expected to carry their University ID Card with them and sign in at the front desk to gain admittance inside the Residence Halls. They will not have access to the resident rooms but may meet with their peers in the Common Room of the Residence Hall. The movement of students visiting Residence Hall rooms is allowed both ways across men’s and women’s Residence Halls between 8:00 am and 12:30 am. The students must sign in and sign out manually through registers maintained at the entrance of all Residences Halls. However, the rights of the roommate supersede the privilege of visitation i.e. visitation is a privilege that is subordinate to the resident’s rights such as the right to privacy and the right to free and uninhibited access to the room. Therefore, a resident’s request for any guest to leave their room must be honoured, irrespective of the visitation hours and regardless of the sex or gender of the guest. Misuse, duplication, and/or lending of your keys and ID Card is prohibited. Students will be personally responsible for the maintenance of their rooms, furniture, bathrooms and University property in their use. The University does not take responsibility for the personal belongings of students on or off campus. Students are prohibited from having private vehicles, pets, weapons and weapons-grade material within campus premises. Note: Kindly refer to the Residence Life Policies available on the portal for more details.      The Residence Life Programme at Ashoka University comprises of a wide variety of vibrant social, educational, recreational and cultural programmes that are run and led by the Residence Life Staff and students. These Residence Life Programmes are centered around the core values and principles of civic responsibility, citizenship, empathy, respect, diversity, inclusion, self-care, health, and wellness. The focus of these programmes is to help foster a sense of community among residents giving them ample opportunities to meet, interact, bond and have fun together.   Resident Assistants (RAs) are paraprofessionals who live on a floor with 40-70 residents, managing critical administrative tasks as well as the primary responsibility of responding to the personal needs of these residents. Their unique positions, as quasi-staff members within the Residence Halls, allow them to act as a force for positive change in the lives of the students with whom they interact. The RA Programme aims to create an inclusive living environment in the Halls of Residence and works towards fostering an environment that embraces diversity and actively values the dignity and self-worth of all members of the community. This is done by the RAs through various active community programming efforts on the floor and across the Residence Halls, regular one-on-one office hours, periodic floor meetings etc. The RAs also plan and host a plethora of social and educational activities for residents thus, enabling a positive living environment in the Residence Halls. These range from events addressing issues of gender & sexuality and self-care to floor cook-offs and game nights to name a few. The Resident Assistant Coordinators (RACs) along with the RA Mentors supervise and manage the RA Programme. The RACs work in tandem with the Dean (Office of Student Affairs) and the Associate Director (Residence Life Office) to develop the RA Programme as a whole. The RACs also serve as mentors to students, and are available during selected business hours to discuss concerns related to Residence as well as Campus Life. Follow us on Instagram :      Dorm Olympics is one of the biggest and most sought-after events organised in the Residence Halls. It began in 2016 with the hope of building the feeling of togetherness and community in a fully residential campus. The fifth edition of the Dorm Olympics, held virtually in February of 2021, was a huge success with the participation of over 300 Ashokans. The event saw participation from all constituencies of the University including students, administration and support staff. Some of the competitive events organised as part of Dorm Olympics include Donuts in a String, Cow Drop, Pani Puri Eating Competition, Dizzy Penalties. To know more, follow us on Instagram : \\xa0      Coffee and More…! aims to create a private, safe space for conversations where students can freely engage with issues and challenges, they face in their everyday lives. These conversations cover a wide range of subjects such as fitness and nutrition, life after college, safety on substance, sleep problems, safe sex practices, reproductive health, bullying, everyday sexism, sexual harassment and much more. By inviting faculty, staff and experts, the series aims to demystify and destigmatize these subjects, allowing for open, free-flowing conversations. Their aim is twofold- one of creating opportunities for an empathetic listening and awareness; other enabling students in dealing with real life challenges and situations towards making an informed choice.      The Great Ashokan Weekend was initiated with the purpose of facilitating student interaction with staff and faculty in a fun and informal setting. Each event of the great Ashokan Weekend is designed as a walk-through of the campus moving between key landmarks on the premises. Despite being held online, the event saw active participation from faculty, staff and students in 2020. Some of the events organised as part of the Great Ashokan Weekend were Pitch Please, Ashoka Family Feud, Fantasy Mess Menu, Pajama Dance Dazel.

About the Department  Philosophy grapples with fundamental questions about the nature of reality, knowledge, and how       we ought to act. Whether in the Indian or Western tradition, answers to these questions have         been supported by rigorous arguments. Our courses offer a historically sensitive immersion in       these arguments. Nevertheless, the philosophy major at Ashoka University aims to equip       students to work beyond the parochialism of either the Indian or Western philosophical tradition        to do philosophy without boundaries.  The philosophy major will equip students with critical reasoning and analytical problem-solving       skills, expressive precision, and the intellectual spaciousness to appreciate and engage rationally       with arguments and points of view with which they profoundly disagree. The Ashoka Philosophy        graduate will be well prepared for higher studies in philosophy or a career in e.g. media, law,         business, or consulting.  People  Current Faculty Members  1.

However, higher-division philosophy courses sometimes have     prerequisites - students are advised to check with the course instructor for such       prerequisites. Moreover, doing philosophy requires rigorous skill in reading a text      closely, writing critically, logical analysis, and sound argumentation. These skills are      often acquired in lower-division courses and it is advisable (but not obligatory) to take        the Introduction to Philosophy and the Symbolic Logic courses before taking      higher-division classes in philosophy.  2. Can I do a thesis before my fourth year (ASP)?  Yes, that is possible. But it will count as an Independent Study Module (ISM).  3. I am not a philosophy major. I want to complete a philosophy thesis in my ASP year. Can          I do so?  Yes, that is possible - all you need to do is find a professor who is willing to supervise          your work. However, it is recommended that you should take some philosophy courses       before doing a thesis.  4. I am taking a philosophy course. I do not know whether it is listed as RC/         IN/HW/CC/EO. How do I find out?  This is easy - just go to the department website page and click on course archive section         ( \\u200b https://www.ashoka.edu.in/page/philosophy-115 \\u200b ).  5. Is there a possibility to get a waiver for any of my degree requirements?  Yes, there is a possibility. You need to discuss with your academic advisor and the Head         of the Department of Philosophy.  6. My question is not listed here. Whom should I approach?  If you cannot find your question here, please write to the student representative of the        philosophy department. \"} score: 0.62802875\n",

Thus the spirit of \\xa0 \\xa0 \\xa0 \\xa0 \\xa0 \\xa0 \\xa0 \\xa0 \\xa0 \\xa0 \\xa0 \\xa0 \\xa0 \\xa0 \\xa0 \\xa0 \\xa0 questioning and the consciousness of one’s own frames of reference is the starting point of \\xa0 \\xa0 \\xa0 \\xa0 \\xa0 \\xa0 \\xa0 \\xa0 \\xa0 \\xa0 \\xa0 \\xa0 \\xa0 \\xa0 \\xa0 historical inquiry. The second feature of imagination is the creative faculty which enables us to \\xa0 \\xa0 \\xa0 \\xa0 \\xa0 \\xa0 \\xa0 \\xa0 \\xa0 \\xa0 \\xa0 \\xa0 \\xa0 \\xa0 \\xa0 form images and feelings that ordinary senses cannot perceive. It is a critical instrument for a \\xa0 \\xa0 \\xa0 \\xa0 \\xa0 \\xa0 \\xa0 \\xa0 \\xa0 \\xa0 \\xa0 \\xa0 \\xa0 \\xa0 \\xa0 \\xa0 historian who studies worlds that are removed both in time and space from his or her own. \\xa0 \\xa0 \\xa0 \\xa0 \\xa0 \\xa0 \\xa0 \\xa0 \\xa0 \\xa0 \\xa0 \\xa0 \\xa0 \\xa0 \\xa0 \\xa0 \\xa0 Conjuring up those historical worlds requires a leap of imagination, a willing suspension of \\xa0 \\xa0 \\xa0 \\xa0 \\xa0 \\xa0 \\xa0 \\xa0 \\xa0 \\xa0 \\xa0 \\xa0 \\xa0 \\xa0 disbelief and a readiness to encounter the unknown. \\xa0 \\xa0 \\xa0 HISTORY MAJOR, MINOR, & CONCENTRATION \\xa0 \\xa0 The Department of History requires students to take a total of \\u200b 12 courses in three years in order \\xa0 \\xa0 \\xa0 \\xa0 \\xa0 \\xa0 \\xa0 \\xa0 \\xa0 \\xa0 \\xa0 \\xa0 \\xa0 \\xa0 \\xa0 \\xa0 \\xa0 \\xa0 to receive the History Major degree and \\u200b 10 to receive the History-IR Major degree, according to \\xa0 \\xa0 \\xa0 \\xa0 \\xa0 \\xa0 \\xa0 \\xa0 \\xa0 \\xa0 \\xa0 \\xa0 \\xa0 \\xa0 \\xa0 \\xa0 UGC guidelines. However, the course should be considered as a four year programme, \\xa0 \\xa0 \\xa0 \\xa0 \\xa0 \\xa0 \\xa0 \\xa0 \\xa0 \\xa0 \\xa0 \\xa0 \\xa0 including the ‘Advanced Major’, which brings the total courses to 16 in four years for History \\xa0 \\xa0 \\xa0 \\xa0 \\xa0 \\xa0 \\xa0 \\xa0 \\xa0 \\xa0 \\xa0 \\xa0 \\xa0 \\xa0 \\xa0 \\xa0 Majors and 14 for History-IR Majors. \\xa0 \\xa0 History students have to do a mix of compulsory and elective courses. Compulsory \\xa0 \\xa0 \\xa0 \\xa0 \\xa0 \\xa0 \\xa0 \\xa0 \\xa0 \\xa0 \\xa0 \\xa0 \\xa0 courses provide students with a basic grounding in the discipline. Elective courses seek to stir, \\xa0 \\xa0 \\xa0 \\xa0 \\xa0 \\xa0 \\xa0 \\xa0 \\xa0 \\xa0 \\xa0 \\xa0 \\xa0 \\xa0 \\xa0 whet, and capture a student’s historical imagination through a conceptual, historiographical \\xa0 \\xa0 \\xa0 \\xa0 \\xa0 \\xa0 \\xa0 \\xa0 \\xa0 \\xa0 \\xa0 and methodological study of different historical themes and subjects. In addition, the UG \\xa0 \\xa0 \\xa0 \\xa0 \\xa0 \\xa0 \\xa0 \\xa0 \\xa0 \\xa0 \\xa0 \\xa0 \\xa0 Research Thesis/Project (for third-year students) and the Capstone Thesis (for ASP students) \\xa0 \\xa0 \\xa0 \\xa0 \\xa0 \\xa0 \\xa0 \\xa0 \\xa0 \\xa0 \\xa0 \\xa0 offer History students opportunities to put into practice their understanding of the discipline of \\xa0 \\xa0 \\xa0 \\xa0 \\xa0 \\xa0 \\xa0 \\xa0 \\xa0 \\xa0 \\xa0 \\xa0 \\xa0 \\xa0 history by undertaking independent inquiry on their chosen historical themes. \\xa0 \\xa0 2 \\xa0History Curriculum \\xa0 \\xa0 \\xa0 History Core Courses: \\xa0 A.\\u200b \\u200b GATEWAY COURSES: \\xa0 ● HIS-1001 European History from Renaissance to Revolution (Spring) \\xa0 ● HIS-2001 History of India I: From Prehistoric Beginnings to the Mauryan Empire \\xa0 (Spring) \\xa0 ● HIS-2002 History of India II: From the Mauryan Empire to c. 1000 CE \\xa0 (Monsoon) \\xa0 ● HIS-2003 History of India III: From c. 1000 CE to 1764 CE (Spring) \\xa0 ● HIS-2004 History of India IV: From 1764 CE to 1967 CE (Spring) \\xa0 \\xa0 B.

Faculty \\xa0 \\xa0 \\xa0 \\xa0 \\xa0 \\xa0 \\xa0 \\xa0 \\xa0 \\xa0 \\xa0 \\xa0 \\xa0 members circulate the source(s) for her class beforehand, with a brief note and a few leading \\xa0 \\xa0 \\xa0 \\xa0 \\xa0 \\xa0 \\xa0 \\xa0 \\xa0 \\xa0 \\xa0 \\xa0 \\xa0 \\xa0 \\xa0 \\xa0 questions. Students read the sources before the class, bring their notes to the class for a \\xa0 \\xa0 \\xa0 \\xa0 \\xa0 \\xa0 \\xa0 \\xa0 \\xa0 \\xa0 \\xa0 \\xa0 \\xa0 \\xa0 \\xa0 \\xa0 discussion led by the faculty member, and then submit their reflections in writing before the \\xa0 \\xa0 \\xa0 \\xa0 \\xa0 \\xa0 \\xa0 \\xa0 \\xa0 \\xa0 \\xa0 \\xa0 \\xa0 \\xa0 \\xa0 next class. Students get an opportunity to study a diverse array of primary sources drawn from \\xa0 \\xa0 \\xa0 \\xa0 \\xa0 \\xa0 \\xa0 \\xa0 \\xa0 \\xa0 \\xa0 \\xa0 \\xa0 \\xa0 \\xa0 \\xa0 various periods of South Asian history. \\xa0 \\xa0 Note: This course has a total of \\u200b 4 credits, but is offered in two parts over two semesters. \\u200b Sources \\xa0 \\xa0 \\xa0 \\xa0 \\xa0 \\xa0 \\xa0 \\xa0 \\xa0 \\xa0 \\xa0 \\xa0 \\xa0 \\xa0 \\xa0 \\xa0 \\xa0 \\xa0 \\xa0 and Histories I (with 2 credits) is offered in the Monsoon Semester and \\u200b Sources and Histories \\xa0 \\xa0 \\xa0 \\xa0 \\xa0 \\xa0 \\xa0 \\xa0 \\xa0 \\xa0 \\xa0 \\xa0 \\xa0 \\xa0 \\xa0 \\xa0 II (with 2 credits) is offered in the Spring Semester.

The Teaching Practicum \\xa0 \\xa0 \\xa0 \\xa0 \\xa0 \\xa0 \\xa0 \\xa0 \\xa0 \\xa0 \\xa0 \\xa0 \\xa0 Assistant (TPA) participates in the lesson planning process, ideally meeting the faculty member \\xa0 \\xa0 \\xa0 \\xa0 \\xa0 \\xa0 \\xa0 \\xa0 \\xa0 \\xa0 \\xa0 \\xa0 \\xa0 to discuss class preparation at least once per week. The TPA is expected to (re)read the assigned \\xa0 \\xa0 \\xa0 \\xa0 \\xa0 \\xa0 \\xa0 \\xa0 \\xa0 \\xa0 \\xa0 \\xa0 \\xa0 \\xa0 \\xa0 \\xa0 \\xa0 readings, and may be given additional readings by the faculty in preparation for class \\xa0 \\xa0 \\xa0 \\xa0 \\xa0 \\xa0 \\xa0 \\xa0 \\xa0 \\xa0 \\xa0 \\xa0 \\xa0 \\xa0 discussions. The TPA is responsible for assisting the faculty with setting up the classroom and \\xa0 \\xa0 \\xa0 \\xa0 \\xa0 \\xa0 \\xa0 \\xa0 \\xa0 \\xa0 \\xa0 \\xa0 \\xa0 \\xa0 \\xa0 holding office hours outside of the class meetings (2 hrs per week) to meet with the students to \\xa0 \\xa0 \\xa0 \\xa0 \\xa0 \\xa0 \\xa0 \\xa0 \\xa0 \\xa0 \\xa0 \\xa0 \\xa0 \\xa0 \\xa0 \\xa0 \\xa0 \\xa0 continue the discussion, help them with paper topics and writing, and other course-related \\xa0 \\xa0 \\xa0 \\xa0 \\xa0 \\xa0 \\xa0 \\xa0 \\xa0 \\xa0 \\xa0 \\xa0 \\xa0 questions. \\xa0 TPA’s will \\u200b not be responsible for grading or evaluating other students’ work, except \\xa0 \\xa0 \\xa0 \\xa0 \\xa0 \\xa0 \\xa0 \\xa0 \\xa0 \\xa0 \\xa0 \\xa0 \\xa0 occasionally may be involved in the grading process with the faculty in order to learn how \\xa0 \\xa0 \\xa0 \\xa0 \\xa0 \\xa0 \\xa0 \\xa0 \\xa0 \\xa0 \\xa0 \\xa0 \\xa0 \\xa0 \\xa0 \\xa0 grading is done. The Teaching Practicum is considered as an apprenticeship, in which the \\xa0 \\xa0 \\xa0 \\xa0 \\xa0 \\xa0 \\xa0 \\xa0 \\xa0 \\xa0 \\xa0 \\xa0 \\xa0 \\xa0 faculty member is responsible to mentor, teach, and train the TPA in pedagogical methods. \\xa0 \\xa0 \\xa0 \\xa0 \\xa0 \\xa0 \\xa0 \\xa0 \\xa0 \\xa0 \\xa0 \\xa0 \\xa0 \\xa0 11 \\xa0TPA’s will also be required to attend pedagogy workshops during the Orientation week. The TPA \\xa0 \\xa0 \\xa0 \\xa0 \\xa0 \\xa0 \\xa0 \\xa0 \\xa0 \\xa0 \\xa0 \\xa0 \\xa0 \\xa0 \\xa0 may be assigned readings over and above the syllabus readings for the rest of the course. The \\xa0 \\xa0 \\xa0 \\xa0 \\xa0 \\xa0 \\xa0 \\xa0 \\xa0 \\xa0 \\xa0 \\xa0 \\xa0 \\xa0 \\xa0 \\xa0 \\xa0 workload should not exceed 3 hrs outside of class time per week. \\xa0 Every Teaching Practicum carries 2 credits. Students who wish to register for a \\xa0 \\xa0 \\xa0 \\xa0 \\xa0 \\xa0 \\xa0 \\xa0 \\xa0 \\xa0 \\xa0 \\xa0 \\xa0 Teaching Practicum will need to apply to the ASP Coordinator of the Department of History \\xa0 \\xa0 \\xa0 \\xa0 \\xa0 \\xa0 \\xa0 \\xa0 \\xa0 \\xa0 \\xa0 \\xa0 \\xa0 \\xa0 \\xa0 (currently Dr Aparna Vaidik) by July for the Monsoon Semester and by December for the Spring \\xa0 \\xa0 \\xa0 \\xa0 \\xa0 \\xa0 \\xa0 \\xa0 \\xa0 \\xa0 \\xa0 \\xa0 \\xa0 \\xa0 \\xa0 \\xa0 Semester. The History Teaching Practicum is meant primarily for History and History-IR \\xa0 \\xa0 \\xa0 \\xa0 \\xa0 \\xa0 \\xa0 \\xa0 \\xa0 \\xa0 \\xa0 \\xa0 Major students who are pursuing the ASP in their fourth year. Other students, including \\xa0 \\xa0 \\xa0 \\xa0 \\xa0 \\xa0 \\xa0 \\xa0 \\xa0 \\xa0 \\xa0 \\xa0 \\xa0 \\xa0 third-year students, may apply for this. The selection of students as TPAs and their allocation to \\xa0 \\xa0 \\xa0 \\xa0 \\xa0 \\xa0 \\xa0 \\xa0 \\xa0 \\xa0 \\xa0 \\xa0 \\xa0 \\xa0 \\xa0 \\xa0 individual courses will be done by the History faculty, taking into account the quality of the \\xa0 \\xa0 \\xa0 \\xa0 \\xa0 \\xa0 \\xa0 \\xa0 \\xa0 \\xa0 \\xa0 \\xa0 \\xa0 \\xa0 \\xa0 \\xa0 applications and pedagogical requirements. The decision and choice of the concerned faculty \\xa0 \\xa0 \\xa0 \\xa0 \\xa0 \\xa0 \\xa0 \\xa0 \\xa0 \\xa0 \\xa0 \\xa0 member will be binding. \\xa0 \\xa0 For further details and guidance about the History ASP, interested students should contact the \\xa0 \\xa0 \\xa0 \\xa0 \\xa0 \\xa0 \\xa0 \\xa0 \\xa0 \\xa0 \\xa0 \\xa0 \\xa0 \\xa0 History ASP Coordinator Dr. Aparna Vaidik. \\xa0 \\xa0 \\xa0 Language Courses \\xa0 \\xa0 The Department of History currently offers two languages - Sanskrit and Persian. The objective \\xa0 \\xa0 \\xa0 \\xa0 \\xa0 \\xa0 \\xa0 \\xa0 \\xa0 \\xa0 \\xa0 \\xa0 \\xa0 \\xa0 for this is to equip History students for historical research in the future. The department \\xa0 \\xa0 \\xa0 \\xa0 \\xa0 \\xa0 \\xa0 \\xa0 \\xa0 \\xa0 \\xa0 \\xa0 \\xa0 \\xa0 \\xa0 strongly encourages its students to learn at least one of these languages while they are at \\xa0 \\xa0 \\xa0 \\xa0 \\xa0 \\xa0 \\xa0 \\xa0 \\xa0 \\xa0 \\xa0 \\xa0 \\xa0 \\xa0 \\xa0 \\xa0 Ashoka. Currently, \\u200b any \\u200b one language course (Persian/ Sanskrit) can count in lieu of \\u200b one History \\xa0 \\xa0 \\xa0 \\xa0 \\xa0 \\xa0 \\xa0 \\xa0 \\xa0 \\xa0 \\xa0 \\xa0 \\xa0 \\xa0 \\xa0 elective in the total course tally of History students. Beyond this, students can take as many \\xa0 \\xa0 \\xa0 \\xa0 \\xa0 \\xa0 \\xa0 \\xa0 \\xa0 \\xa0 \\xa0 \\xa0 \\xa0 \\xa0 \\xa0 \\xa0 language courses as they want.

My view is that literature can be more productively studied when literary and legal materials are placed next to each other. This approach does not treat law as the taken-for-granted backdrop that students already know, but instead makes explicit the similarities and differences between the two areas. What you have already learned about the law in other classes (no prerequisites required!) is not inevitably alien to the qualities of literary writing and analysis. In that way, the course is designed to show how legal modes of thought are sometimes already present in literary texts and vice versa. To that end, my syllabus combines literary readings, literary criticism, judicial opinions, and legal scholarship. Questions we will ask: How does literature use or respond to legal structures, themes, and analytical techniques, and vice versa? How does literature portray legal institutions and processes? What can literature bring to the performance of legal tasks, including legal narrative? To what extent can literary critical accounts of narrative structure and coherence explain the role of narrative in law, and where do these accounts fall short? What is achieved and what is missed by positing literature as law’s “other” (e.g., as the imaginative and ethical alternative to legal rules and constraints)? We will take up various problems at the intersection of law and literature: legal fictions, forms of legal writing and explanation, and the regulation of literature through copyright law. Next we will focus on two legal problems that have also occupied literary thinkers: the problem of criminal responsibility and literature’s ability to document human thought and motives, and the question of privacy in criminal law, tort law, and fiction. Afterwards, we will explore the concept of jurisdiction, terra nullius, and crown land. We will end by considering possible future directions for law and literature. Reading list includes Dorian Gray, The Importance of Being Earnest, Dr. Jekyll and Mr. Hyde, The Round House, and The House of the Vampire.

Complex questions about sexuality, conflict, self, identity and science are navigated with reference to books, and fragments of books, from across geographies and chronologies These books and questions form the core of the course and its explorations.    Department: English | Semester: Monsoon 2022 In this course, we will address the question “What is sexuality” by reading some of the many books that have shaped our current ideas of the subject. These books will range across chronologies, cultures, and disciplines, starting with classical and medieval Indic texts — the Kamasutra, Sufi poetry — to ancient Greek and Roman classics — the Symposium, the Metamorphoses. We will also read philosophical texts like the Discourse on Method, biological texts like The Origin of Species, psychoanalytical texts like The Interpretation of Dreams, and literary texts like Mary Shelley’s Frankenstein. Together, these “great books” will allow us to trace threads that have gone into our current ways of thinking about sexuality.    Department: History | Semester: Monsoon 2022 and Spring 2023 In this course, through certain texts, and in some cases, parts of texts students are invited to explore a series of complex and variegated themes and issues.\\xa0 Some of these are the relationship between knowledge and ignorance, darkness and truth; the relationship between identity and destiny; narratological techniques; understanding of the historical processes and ideology; and the quest to discover the self to emancipate it from the restrictions that society imposes on the self. The books through which these issues are pursued are: Isa Upanishad King Oedipus By Sophocles Mahabharata (Selected Themes) Vindication of The Rights Of Women By Mary Wollstonecraft Tuhfat Al Muwahhidin By Rammohun Roy The Communist Manifesto by Karl Marx A Room of One’s Own by Virginia Woolf \\xa0    Department: History | Semester: Monsoon 2022 It is a truism that words mean something, and that they count for a great deal in life. However, the relation between thought, reality, and time has always been a matter of debate. The Greek word theoria meant contemplation, the act of looking, which later acquired the sense of an intelligible explanation based on observation and reasoning. Historia meant inquiry, the search for knowledge; and it evolved over time to mean investigations and accounts of past events. Philosophia meant the love of wisdom. These words, which relate to human experience in its deepest sense, prompt my choice of great books. As to why this is so should become clear in due course. The books are: Simon Leys; The Hall of Uselessness: Collected Essays, (2011) Tibor Szamuely; The Russian Tradition; (1974) Margaret Chatterjee; Gandhi and the Challenge of Religious Diversity; (2005) Albert Camus; The Rebel: An Essay on Man in Revolt; (1956) Mark Lilla; The Reckless Mind: Intellectuals in Politics; (2001) Stanley Rosen; Nihilism: A Philosophical Essay (1969) The first three books deal (in part) with history; with what is called tradition; and the treatment of these themes in political writing and fiction. The latter three deal with philosophical issues directly. I will introduce students to these books and specify certain chapters for required reading. Their scholarship will educate us and prompt us toward further study. Some will illuminate important historical events; others will raise issues common to human experience regardless of time and place.    Department: Undergraduate Writing Program | Semester: Monsoon 2022 In Quest Of Who goes on quests? And what kinds of quests are they? Epics across mythologies have followed courageous (and controversial) men and women on long, unforgettable journeys. Novels host protagonists seeking all kinds of things: the ship captain vowing revenge against a whale; the little prince leaving his asteroid home in search of wisdom. A play reveals a quest that is absurd, even circular — what if you are waiting for someone who never arrives? — and one poet describes the spiritual quest of pilgrimage as an “urgent, unreasonable sojourn into uncertainty.” People have wondered and wandered into adventure long before they began writing about it, and this course will attempt to catch up with some of them and follow along. We will go in quest of them, just as they did before us. And we will also question them, just as they did before us.    Department: Sanskrit | Semester: Spring 2023 Rock, paper, palm leaf – Making sense of texts and textual traditions In this course, we will examine texts from the subcontinent, with an eye to mapping their natural history. That is, we will read selections from stories, poems, inscriptions, and other, more conventional ‘texts’ in Sanskrit, Prakrit, and Tamil, and try to understand the larger literary and intellectual projects that they are part of. We will learn to attend to the authors’ discursive and figural techniques, while also gathering a sense of the transmission and reception of their works and ideas. What is the connection between story and ritual? What does an inscription say? Who reads it? Who wrote the grammars of ritual, poetry, politics, and ethics? Were they read? And were these protocols followed? These are some of the questions we will pose in this course. Texts we will read from include:\\xa0 Veda (verse, prose), early sutra texts Mahābhārata, Yājñavalkya-smṛti Ṭherīgāthā, Aśvaghoṣa Kāmasūtra, Piṅgala (Prosody) Arthaśāstra (Politics), Aśokan, Nāneghāṭ Inscriptions Mahābhāṣya, Tolkāppiyam (Grammar) Carakasaṃhitā (Medicine), Nāṭyaśāstra (Theatre) Eṭṭutokai, Gāhā sattasa’ī (Anthologies of poetry) Yogasūtra, Varāhamihira Meghadūta, Setubandha (Kāvya), Mehrauli and Mandasaur inscriptions Tamil bhakti poems Vāsudevahiṇḍi and the Dhuttākkhāṇa    Semester : Spring 2023 This course will look at books that negotiate the relationship between bodies and words. Books are both textual and performative in nature, and we will pay attention to both these aspects over the course of the semester. Beginning with classical texts from the subcontinent (Samkhyakarika and Yoga Sutras) that are reliant on body or matter, the course will examine the 16th century Protestant drive to vest ultimate authority in the text, establishing the word’s primacy over both body and lived experience. Great Books will critically examine this idealism through readings of Spinoza, Weber, Bauman, Vivekananda and Tagore; focus on modern Indic writings that articulate the tension between tradition and modernity, theory and experience particularly in relation to body and caste (Ambedkar/Gandhi, Sundar Sarrukai/Gopal Guru, Ramachandran Guha); and conclude with readings of poetic texts from across the world, Kalidas, Ikkyu, Hafiz, Annamachrya, Akka Mahadevi, Whitman, Neruda and others that go beyond the word, transgress the norm, and reinstate the body, its sensuality and eroticism, at the centre of the self. \\xa0                  Programme Interested InUndergraduate ProgrammeYoung India FellowshipYSPPhDMA - EconomicsMA EnglishMSC Biology Year of Admission2022-232023-242024-252025-26  Subscribe to our communications [current_url]     Plot No. 2, Rajiv Gandhi Education City, National Capital Region P.O.

      "To apply for the study abroad programme, students need to submit an application form, a personal statement, and two letters of recommendation. The application deadline is typically in March for the summer programme. Students who are selected for the programme will be required to pay a programme fee.\n",

    "# RAG Implementation Comparison: Custom vs. LangChain\n",
    "\n",
    "## Overview\n",
    "\n",
    "In this notebook, I've implemented two versions of Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG):\n",
    "\n",
    "1. A custom implementation built from scratch\n",
    "2. An implementation using LangChain\n",
    "\n",
    "## Key Findings\n",
    "\n",
    "### Custom Implementation\n",
    "- Built entirely from scratch\n",
    "- Offers more control over the process\n",
    "- Resulted in a more manageable size for Lambda deployment\n",
    "\n",
    "### LangChain Implementation\n",
    "- Utilized the LangChain library for RAG\n",
    "- Provided pre-built components and easier setup\n",
    "- Resulted in significantly larger deployment size\n",
    "\n",
    "## Deployment Challenges\n",
    "\n",
    "When attempting to deploy these implementations to AWS Lambda, I encountered notable differences:\n",
    "\n",
    "- **Custom Implementation**: Successfully deployed within Lambda's size limits\n",
    "- **LangChain Implementation**: Faced size-related errors during deployment\n",
    "\n",
    "### Note on Multiple Layers\n",
    "While I'm aware of the possibility of using multiple layers in Lambda to accommodate larger dependencies, this approach provided minimal improvements for the LangChain implementation. The size reduction was not significant enough to justify the added complexity of managing multiple layers.\n",
    "\n",
    "## Conclusion\n",
    "\n",
    "For my use case, the custom RAG implementation proved more suitable for Lambda deployment due to its smaller size footprint. While LangChain offers convenience and pre-built components, its size makes it challenging to deploy in serverless environments like Lambda without significant compromises.\n",
    "\n",
    "The trade-off between development ease (LangChain) and deployment simplicity (custom implementation) is evident. For Lambda-based deployments, the custom approach appears to be more practical and cost-effective in the long run."

Minor in Entrepreneurial Leadership And Strategy All under graduate cohorts must complete 24 credits in Entrepreneurial Leadership and Strategy to obtain a minor degree. A student can opt for any combination of 4 and 2-credit courses to meet the credit requirements. Entrepreneurial Leadership And Strategy is the largest and most popular Minor at Ashoka University . 2. Concentration in Entrepreneurial Leadership And Strategy All under graduate cohorts must complete 16 credits in Entrepreneurial Leadership and Strategy to obtain a concentration in the discipline. A student can opt for any combination of 4 and 2-credit courses to meet the credit requirements. 3. Interdisciplinary Major in Computer Science and Entrepreneurship To obtain an Interdisciplinary major in Computer Science and Entrepreneurship, in addition to a pure major in Computer Science, students must complete at least 16 credits in Entrepreneurial Leadership and Strategy . 6 Prerequisites for Courses The Department has set no prerequisites for any courses. There is no level-wise sequence of courses you will have to take and hence are free to take courses in any order . However , it is recommended that students take the basic courses first before moving on to the advanced courses. Other Credit Options 1. Independent Study Module (4 credits) ISM is a course option that allows students to collaborate closely with a faculty member . These courses can be worth 4 or 2 credits and offer students the chance to engage in research, in ongoing faculty projects or on a topic of their interest. To begin an ISM, students can email a faculty before the semester starts, expressing their interest in undertaking an ISM under their guidance. The project or paper should be discussed with the faculty member and Dr. Priyank- Director/Head of the Department It is necessary to obtain faculty approval before registering for the ISM course. 2. Teaching Assistance (TA-ship) As a teaching assistant (TA), your responsibilities may vary depending on the course. These typically include grading quizzes, facilitating discussion sessions, conducting doubt-clearing office hours, and assisting with various logistical aspects of the classes. TAships are generally available to third-year students and ASP students. Though having prior experience in the course can certainly be beneficial, it is not necessarily required to take the specific course before to be a TA. The Taship will yield the same credits as the course, i.e. a 4-credit course will give 4 credits and a 7 2-credit course will yield 2 credits. These credits can be used to complete Minor/Concentration requirements. 3. Study Abroad Note that, like any other program at Ashoka, the Study Abroad Programs are subject to changes. Kindly refer to the GESP website for the latest information. Additionally , contact the department HOD for further clarification regarding credit transfers . Every summer and semester , international universities offer under graduate courses in different subjects and fields. These courses can be transferred (subject to faculty approval) to the total credits taken as Ashoka. The Office of Global Education and Strategic Programmes (GESP) is available to students for assistance and counselling in the application process. Ashoka is currently partnered with Wellesley College, UC Berkeley , University of Pennsylvania, Yale University , King’ s College London, University of Michigan, Penn Engineering, Sciences Po, and Trinity College Dublin and many more.

While the booming startup ecosystem in India reﬂects the surge in entrepreneurship, bigger companies in the corporate sector are also embracing innovation and intrapreneurship to stay relevant and succeed in a fast-changing world. However , innovation needs to be rooted in customer -centricity . As seen in recent years, many promising startups have gone astray because of excessive valuation focus, or because founders are fixated on technology rather than customers & revenues. This hands-on boot camp course aims to intertwine theory & practice so that students learn key concepts of new ventures and implement them with firmly customer -centric actions. This course also aims to prepare students with the right balance of hard and soft skills. On the one hand, students – who so desire- would be well equipped to pursue their startup dreams. On the other hand, students who want to work in the corporate sector will have the confidence to be successful intrapreneurs driving innovation in these larger companies. In this course, students will experience the full journey from an Idea to an MVP (Minimum Viable Product) all the while keeping a sharp focus on customer centricity . In each class session, a ‘hard’ or ‘soft’ startup concept “(“theory”) will be introduced in the class. Students will then (working in groups) execute that concept (“practical”) in the weeks to come. This will be done, class after class, as students get exposed to a series of concepts that are important for the development of an early-stage customer -centric venture. Students will also do individual reﬂection during the first few weeks, and then at some periodicity . 35 Frequently Asked Questions (FAQs) Q: Can 1st yr students directly start 2000 and 3000 level courses for the Spring 25 semester?

When we stepped into 2022, there was still fear and caution about the pandemic lingering around. We continued living our professional lives through the boxes on our screens for almost the entirety of the first quarter. This was not much difficult for any as the inertia of WFH had already kicked in, the challenge was to break it, shun our pyjamas, and don a mask in a physical setting. There were students and colleagues who had started their journey with us virtually. It was an exciting period post the mid-sem break in March to finally meet them and get back into our work space and classrooms after two springs. We had kickstarted the Spring Semester in January with a major uptick in the number of Entrepreneurship courses being offered. We were fortunate to have some of the pioneers and thought leaders in their respective fields teaching our students. From Pramod Bhasin, the Founder of Genpact doing a Leadership course to Raman Roy, a leader in the Indian BPO Industry and a prolific investor doing a course on How to Start a Startup. Then we had courses on the themes of digital transformation, real estate, finance, and investing added to our course catalogue. The trend of the Entrepreneurship course offerings going north continued for the Monsoon Semester in September with some amazing courses being offered in the areas of Leadership, Strategy, Finance, Digital Transformation, Management and Entrepreneurship. The number of students being engaged by us makes Entrepreneurship the biggest minor on campus. Our courses even attracted staff and alums who sit through them. I am particularly proud of a first-year student who spent her Monday evening voluntarily attending Aditya Ghosh’s In Pursuit of Service Excellence course. An alumnus travelled all the way from Gurgaon to attend the same class. It is these acts of dedication and determination that keep us going, and act as an assurance that we are on the right track. As always, our courses had learning components even beyond the classroom through late-night Dhaba conversations with the faculty and guest speakers, field trips, and real-life immersive assignments where the students had the opportunity to gain hands-on experience through directly working with organizations, running live social media marketing campaigns, conducting sales research on the field, and even minting NFTs. A highlight of this year was the Dinner with Founders where our students could interact with Ashoka University founders like Ashish Dhawan, Pramath Raj Sinha, and Aditya Ghosh interact with students in an informal setting, singing along with them while strumming the guitar. Another gratifying moment this year for us has been to see so many of our Entrepreneurship students acknowledging that their experiences with us have immensely contributed to their success during the Placement Season. We continued empowering and supporting student-led initiatives on campus through various clubs like the Entrepreneurship Club and the Business Club, better known on the campus as E-Club and B-Club, besides assisting the Ashoka Investment and Consulting Clubs. They have surely been able to enhance the level of engagement on campus through their various intra as well as inter-institution events. Supporting the startup founders and the startup ecosystem is of prime importance to us. The Startup Incubation Lab and the Entrepreneur-in-Residence programs witnessed Ashokapreneurs (student and alum startup founders) being systematically supported by mentors like Srikant Sastri, the President of TiE Delhi-NCR. We also participated in initiatives to strengthen the startup support ecosystems locally as well as globally. Collaboration is a cornerstone of Entrepreneurship, and we were able to contribute to some interesting initiatives like the Panchkula Urban Dialogues with the Government of Haryana and the Registrar’s Office, Inclusion Through Innovation: Designing Barrier-free Environments with the OLS, and an L&D initiative for the staff and a fun staff after hours with the HR. As Entrepreneurship at Ashoka progressed in leaps and bounds, there was a personal high for me in 2022. My book, ‘Leapfrog: Six Practices to Thrive at Work‘ co-authored with Prof. Mukesh Sud was published by Penguin India. It lays down six evidence-based insights to help readers advance their careers at an incredible pace. In 2023, as we look to reinforce our various offerings including our courses, we would strive to promote and practice Human Centered Entrepreneurship and live the Ashoka Sutra values. We definitely want the weeks of 2023 to become fruitful, and help us set even higher benchmarks for ourselves. May 2023 in the pages of Ashoka’s history be a period where a ‘decade’ happened.

      "{'page_content': '--- title: Undergraduate Programme in Computer Science sitename: Undergraduate Programme in Computer Science - Ashoka University date: 2024-09-06 --- The undergraduate Computer Science (CS) major at Ashoka acknowledges the relevance of computing and information science to every academic discipline and emphasizes exposure to interdisciplinary research that will drive innovation in the future. In addition to courses in traditional CS fields like systems, theory and AI, students will be able to leverage the multidisciplinary interests of the faculty to study newer fields like human-centred computing, social and information networks, digital humanities, data-driven journalism, and cyber law. They will not only develop a diverse set of skills to prepare for graduate school and for employment but will also be encouraged to launch their own startups or venture into new types of careers using their interdisciplinary training. Our curriculum takes into account the ACM curriculum guidelines for undergraduate degrees in computer science and exposes students to modern advancements and new sub-fields of computer science. The main goals of the programme are: Develop the core set of technical skills that will prepare students for employment or further studies Gain a deeper understanding of the scientific and relevant mathematical underpinnings of computer science and learn to apply them practically Identify and solve the most challenging computer science problems, and work towards developing new ideas and creating new knowledge in the field of computer science Understand the social context in which students’ knowledge and work of computer science will be used, and engage in collaborative work with members of a team outside the discipline Apart from a major in CS, students can also opt for a minor in CS, or inter-disciplinary majors in CS and Entrepreneurship, and in CS and Mathematics. CS major students are strongly encouraged to enrol in the Ashoka Scholars Programme, which will confer postgraduate diplomas following a year of advanced study, research, and field work. This unique one-year programme combines a real-life, academically rigorous research project and internship taken alongside a set of electives so that students can enter into successful academic and professional careers with ample experience in their fields. As per the NEP Curriculum The 4-year BSc Hons degree / 4-year BSc Hons with Research degree in Computer Science mandates a minimum of 150 credits for completion, ensuring a well-rounded education encompassing both core computer science knowledge and broader academic experiences. 3-year BSc Hons degree in Computer Science For students who exit at the end of 3 years, they receive a 3-year BSc Hons degree in Computer Science. The later mandates a minimum of 114 credits for completion. For batch before UG’25, the following were the requirements: To receive a B.Sc. degree with a major in Computer Science students must accumulate 100 credit points at the end of three years. The course divisions and credit points requirement within three years for a major in Computer Science are as follows For NEP batches to obtain a Minor in Computer Science, you are required to successfully complete 24 academic credits, typically equivalent to six courses, offered by the Computer Science department. The following courses are mandatory: In addition, you must select three more courses from the Computer Science department. ISMs are not considered as valid CS electives for Minor requirements. For batches before UG’25 In order to get a Minor in Computer Science, students are required to take In order to Major in an interdisciplinary degree, students must accumulate 116 credit points at the end of three years – i.e., 16 credit points more than what is required for a pure Major. The Computer Science department offers two interdisciplinary Majors – (i) Computer Science and Mathematics, and (ii) Computer Science and Entrepreneurship. The course divisions and credit points requirement within three years for these two Interdisciplinary Major are as follows : For batches UG25 & UG2023 onwards Computer Science and Mathematics Computer Science and Entrepreneurial Leadership Computer Science and Philosophy For NEP batches to obtain a Concentration in Computer Science, you are required to successfully complete 16 academic credits, typically equivalent to 4 courses, offered by the Computer Science department. The following courses are mandatory: In addition, you must select one more course from the Computer Science department. ISMs are not considered as valid CS electives for concentration requirements. For batches before UG’25 In order to get a Concentration in Computer Science, students are required to take any four (16 credits) Computer Science courses. The list of computer science elective courses includes, but are not limited to, Ashoka University’s Department of Computer Science offers undergraduate programmes which teach students the fundamental skills and knowledge of the discipline.

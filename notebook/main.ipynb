FAQs      20         2 Introduction Physics is a doorway to some of the most beautiful and profound phenomena in the universe like black holes, supernovae, Bose -Einstein condensates, superconductors. It is, simultaneously, a driver of lifestyle -changing technology, e.g., engines, electricity, and transistors; and a powerful way of perceiving and analyzing problems that can be applied in various domains, both within and outside standard physics. The beauty and profundity of the phenomena studied by physicists offer romance and excite passion, and the utility of its discoveries and th e power of its methods arouse interest.  These methods can be very intricate and demanding: theoretical physics requires a skilful combination of physical and mathematical thinking, and experimental physics requires in addition the ability to turn tentati ve ideas into physical devices that can put those ideas to the test. As a result, the successful practice of physics demands rigour, flexibility, mechanical adroitness, persistence, and great imagination. The physicist’s imagination is nourished not just b y physics but also by other areas of human enquiry and thought, of the kind that an Ashoka undergraduate is expected to encounter.  With all of this in mind, the physics programme has been designed to: (i) allow students wishing to major in physics to discov er real physics and make a wise choice, in the first year; (ii) provide, throughout, a thorough training in fundamental physics; (iii) bring together everything learnt earlier, and give students the option to pursue more advanced courses in physics or branch out into other areas, in the third year. The idea is to accompany those wishing to become professional physicists as they take the f irst steps in that direction, and to introduce everyone who goes through the programme to the physicist’s way of thinking.     3 Physics Major – Typical Trajectory Semester 2: Discovering UG -level Physics A student wishing to major, minor, or pursue a concentration in Physics is expected to take the introductory course in calculus (Calculus I) offered by the Mathematics Department. Students wishing to major in Physics should plan to take it in their first s emester.  Requirement for Physics major : 13 core physics courses + 2 electives (60 credits)  The physics -major sequence begins in semester 2, with two courses, one in theoretical physics and the other in experimental physics. The first purpose of these c ourses is to provide an experience of UG level physics on the basis of which a student can decide whether or not to major in physics, i.e., they are gateway courses. The second purpose of these courses is to serve as an introduction to the physicist’s way of thinking about problems and solving them, something that has proved useful not just to physicists but also to those in other disciplines that make use of quantitative methods and experiments, e.g., mathematics, computer science, economics, psychology, a nd biology.  Semester 3, 4 and 5: The Physics Core  The physics courses in these 3 semesters form the core of the physicist’s undergraduate canon. Anyone majoring in physics is expected to be thorough in these areas. Each semester has 2 -3 theory courses and an accompanying lab.  Semester 6: Exploring more advanced options  The student can opt for elective courses: each student majoring in physics is required to take at least two. From the student’s point of view, the electives chosen is likely to indicate a post -graduate direction – towards theoretical physics, towards experimental physics or perhaps away from physics into an allied discipline that would benefit from training in physics.        4 Physics Minor or Concentration  To Minor in physics a student must do six courses in physics (24 credits). Of these the two gateway courses – MP1 and Lab 1 – are compulsory. At least two more courses should be taken from among the core courses offered in semesters 3, 4, and 5, provided a ppropriate prerequisites have been satisfied for these courses (recommended courses: Classical Mechanics and Thermal Physics).  The remaining two may be either other compulsory or elective courses offered by the Physics Department or cross -listed with Phy sics, provided appropriate prerequisites have been satisfied. In place of one elective course, a student may take an Independent Study Module (ISM) of equivalent credit.  For a Concentration in physics a student must do six courses in physics (16 credits ). Of these the two gateway courses – MP1 and Lab 1 – are compulsory.  At least two more courses should be taken from among the core courses offered in semesters 3, 4, and 5, provided appropriate prerequisites have been satisfied for these courses (recomm ended courses: Classical Mechanics and Thermal Physics)          5 General Information on the Physics Courses Mathematical level — All theory courses are calculus -based. The level of mathematical sophistication will increase progressively. The mathematical - physics courses will be application -oriented rather than proof -oriented. Familiarity with +2 level physics and mathematics is a ssumed.  Labs — All lab courses will involve extensive use of instruments to make observations. These experiments will in general illustrate ideas studied in the accompanying theory courses.  The use of computers — Many theory courses will include computa tional exercises, generally using the programming language Python. Labs will also require the use of computers.  Duration — Theory courses: two lectures a week each lasting 1.5 hours. In addition, there may be a 1.5 -hour tutorial per week . Laboratory: one 3 -hour main lab session per week and one 3 -hour extra session per week for lab course.

Students will also be introduced to ideas of thermometry and calibration.  Pre-requisi tes: Physics Lab I.        8 Quantum Mechanics (semester 5) This course is an introduction to Quantum Mechanics (QM). Starting with a historical introduction and motivation, it goes on to introduce probability amplitudes as the fundamental physical basis for QM. Using the Dirac bra -ket notation, the fundamental postulates are then introduced and their consequences worked out. The basic physical concepts are illustrated through spin -½ systems and one -dimensional wave mechanics. Symmetries and Conservation laws in QM are discussed, an introduction to the basic theory of angular momentum and spin is given, and the course culminates with the first major triumph of QM - a quantum mechanical understanding of the hydrogen atom.  Pre-requisites: Classical Mechanics, M athematical Physics I and II.  Strongly recommended: Linear Algebra (Department of Mathematics).  Statistical Mechanics (semester 5) Statistical mechanics allows one to solve problems involving large numbers of particles by exploiting statistical regularities.

Alternatively, students wishing to broaden their education further can use it to take a minor/concentration in any other subject or simply take whatev er courses in any department they wish to.  Advanced Major The advanced major is for students intending to pursue higher studies and research in physics. It would enable them to take some advanced physics courses as well as get an idea of research through the capstone project/thesis.  Requirements: 7th Semester: Required to take 16 credits of which the capstone project comprises 8 credits. The students can opt for 1 or 2 courses comprising 4 credits/course.  8th Semester: Required to take 16 credits of which the capstone project comprises 8 credits. The students can opt for 1 or 2 courses comprising 4 credits/course.  Over the whole year (2 semesters), some courses apart from Thesis may also be taken from outside the physics department .     11 Capstone Project and Thesis:  Interested students should talk, in their 6th semester, to prospective advisors about possible projects. After mutual agreement - the advisor agrees to guide the student and the student agrees to work on one of the projects suggested by the advisor - stude nts should start with necessary background reading / preliminary work over the summer before the start of the fourth year.  At the end of the 7th semester the project would be assessed with a presentation and report - this will be evaluated by the physics faculty. Students without satisfactory progress at this stage may not continue for the thesis subsequently.  At the end of the 8th semester the thesis has to be submitted and defended before a panel which may also include some external members. It is mandatory to successfully complete the capstone project and thesis to be eligible for the advanced major.  Other options (Minor/Concentration)  Students not opting for the advanced major can take courses as per their interest in the fourth year. It is reco mmended that physics majors take two physics electives over the year. Those minoring in physics (or taking it as a concentration) may take physics courses accordingly to meet the necessary requirements.               12 TF/TA -ship Policy ❖ The Teaching Fellows are recruited after a departmental screening process.  ❖ Fourth year (ASP) physics students can be TAs for some of the introductory physics courses. This depends on the departmental requirement and the position may be offered either for credits or may be a paid position.  ❖ MLS students are assigned to be TAs as a part of their academic requirements.  Independent Study Module (ISM) ❖ Students may opt for an ISM if interested and if a faculty member is available for this purpose.  ❖ A successfully completed ISM would contribute 2 to 4 credits to the student’s GPA.  ❖ Students who wish to take up an ISM should contact the Professor under whose guidance they wish to work to discuss details.       13 Faculty  Somendra M.

Pre-requis ites: none.  Classical Mechanics (semester 3) Newtonian mechanics and an introduction to Lagrangian and Hamiltonian mechanics. Newtonian mechanics is, both historically and otherwise, the starting point of all of physics. The Lagrangian and Hamiltonian formulations of classical mechanics allow a more profound vision of the subject while also introducing the language in which much of higher -level theoretical physics is expressed.  Pre-requisites: MP1  Electricity & Magnetism in Light of Relativity (semester 3 ) The beautiful theory of electricity and magnetism is, with classical mechanics, the heart of c lassical physics. What is often not appreciated at the undergraduate level is that electricity and magnetism are related in a way that reveals the structure of space -time. In this course relativity will be used from the beginning to relate electric and mag netic fields, so that their unity, as components of the electromagnetic field are revealed and used in the study of Maxwell’s Equations.  Pre-requisites: MP1  Physics Lab 2 (semester 3) Designed to accompany the theory courses Classical Mechanics and Ele ctricity & Magnetism in Light of Relativity, this laboratory course explores their experimental foundations. Students will be introduced to video -analysis and modelling to study elastic and inelastic collisions, uniformly accelerated motion, and terminal v elocity. In addition, students will also be introduced to physical systems exhibiting electromagnetic damping, resonant electronics circuits, and two -dimensional electrostatics.  Pre-requisites: Physics Lab 1      7 Mathematical Physics 2 (semester 4 ) This mathematical physics course aims to be an introduction to differential equations. Besides standard topics in ordinary and partial differential equations, nonlinear dynamical systems will be studied and nonlinear ODEs will be analysed using geometric a nd computational tools. Fourier series will also be studied.  Pre-requisites: MP1  Thermal Physics (semester 4) An Integrated Approach to Thermodynamics and Kinetic Theory. There are three approaches to study systems with large numbers of atoms and molec ules, which exhibit properties like temperature and entropy: kinetic theory, classical thermodynamics, and statistical mechanics. In this course, these three approaches will be taught in an integrated fashion.  Pre-requisites: Mathematical Physics 1.  Oscillations, Waves, and Optics (semester 4) Oscillatory phenomena appear in all areas of physics, both classical and quantum (to the point where a famous textbook begins by saying that the domain of physics is all phenomena that can be reduced to coupled oscillators). The methods used to study oscillatory motion are powerful and wide -ranging in their utility.  Pre-requisites: MP1, Classical Mechanics and Electricity & Magnetism.  Physics Lab 3 (semester 4) Designed to accompany the theory courses Therma l Physics and Oscillations, Waves & Optics, this laboratory course explores their experimental foundations. Students will be introduced to the properties of light as a wave: interference, diffraction, and polarisation, through conceptually rich experiments like the Michelson Interferometer. In addition, mechanical systems which exhibit oscillatory behaviour, like coupled pendula and capillary waves, will also be studied. Students will also be introduced to ideas of thermometry and calibration.  Pre-requisi tes: Physics Lab I.        8 Quantum Mechanics (semester 5) This course is an introduction to Quantum Mechanics (QM). Starting with a historical introduction and motivation, it goes on to introduce probability amplitudes as the fundamental physical basis for QM. Using the Dirac bra -ket notation, the fundamental postulates are then introduced and their consequences worked out. The basic physical concepts are illustrated through spin -½ systems and one -dimensional wave mechanics. Symmetries and Conservation laws in QM are discussed, an introduction to the basic theory of angular momentum and spin is given, and the course culminates with the first major triumph of QM - a quantum mechanical understanding of the hydrogen atom.  Pre-requisites: Classical Mechanics, M athematical Physics I and II.  Strongly recommended: Linear Algebra (Department of Mathematics).  Statistical Mechanics (semester 5) Statistical mechanics allows one to solve problems involving large numbers of particles by exploiting statistical regularities. When combined with quantum mechanics, it helps physicists to understand some of the most fascinating phenomena in the universe. This course is an introduction to the essential concepts of the subject.  Pre-requisites: Thermal Physics.  Physics Lab 4 (semester 5) Designed to accompany the two theory courses Quantum Mechanics and Statistical Mechanics; this laboratory course explor es their experimental foundations. Students will be introduced to some of the experiments which require Quantum Mechanics in order to be explained, notably discrete atomic spectra and the Zeeman Effect. The lab will also contain experiments on Brownian Mot ion and the determination of other properties of matter like magnetic susceptibility.  Pre-requisites: Physics Lab I.  The Physics of Matter (semester 6 ) In real physical systems the various areas of fundamental physics that are studied separately in pre vious semesters are usually required all at once. The purpose of this course is to show how fundamental physics can be used to study a number of interesting phenomena.  Pre-requisites: All mandatory courses in the physics -major sequence.     9 Elective Physics Courses  Elective courses (for the 3rd and 4th year) are listed below.

Alternatively, students wishing to broaden their education further can use it to take a minor/concentration in any other subject or simply take whatev er courses in any department they wish to.  Advanced Major The advanced major is for students intending to pursue higher studies and research in physics. It would enable them to take some advanced physics courses as well as get an idea of research through the capstone project/thesis.  Requirements: 7th Semester: Required to take 16 credits of which the capstone project comprises 8 credits. The students can opt for 1 or 2 courses comprising 4 credits/course.  8th Semester: Required to take 16 credits of which the capstone project comprises 8 credits. The students can opt for 1 or 2 courses comprising 4 credits/course.  Over the whole year (2 semesters), some courses apart from Thesis may also be taken from outside the physics department .     11 Capstone Project and Thesis:  Interested students should talk, in their 6th semester, to prospective advisors about possible projects. After mutual agreement - the advisor agrees to guide the student and the student agrees to work on one of the projects suggested by the advisor - stude nts should start with necessary background reading / preliminary work over the summer before the start of the fourth year.  At the end of the 7th semester the project would be assessed with a presentation and report - this will be evaluated by the physics faculty. Students without satisfactory progress at this stage may not continue for the thesis subsequently.  At the end of the 8th semester the thesis has to be submitted and defended before a panel which may also include some external members. It is mandatory to successfully complete the capstone project and thesis to be eligible for the advanced major.  Other options (Minor/Concentration)  Students not opting for the advanced major can take courses as per their interest in the fourth year. It is reco mmended that physics majors take two physics electives over the year. Those minoring in physics (or taking it as a concentration) may take physics courses accordingly to meet the necessary requirements.               12 TF/TA -ship Policy ❖ The Teaching Fellows are recruited after a departmental screening process.  ❖ Fourth year (ASP) physics students can be TAs for some of the introductory physics courses. This depends on the departmental requirement and the position may be offered either for credits or may be a paid position.  ❖ MLS students are assigned to be TAs as a part of their academic requirements.  Independent Study Module (ISM) ❖ Students may opt for an ISM if interested and if a faculty member is available for this purpose.  ❖ A successfully completed ISM would contribute 2 to 4 credits to the student’s GPA.  ❖ Students who wish to take up an ISM should contact the Professor under whose guidance they wish to work to discuss details.       13 Faculty  Somendra M.

It is a doorway to some of the most beautiful and profound phenomena in the universe, e.g. black holes, supernovae, Bose-Einstein condensates, superconductors. It is a driver of lifestyle-changing technology, e.g. engines, electricity, and transistors. And it is a powerful way of perceiving and analysing problems that can be applied in various domains, both within and outside standard physics. The beauty and profundity of the phenomena studied by physicists offer romance and excite passion; the utility of its discoveries and the power of its methods arouse interest. These methods can be very intricate and demanding: theoretical physics requires a skilful combination of physical and mathematical thinking, and experimental physics requires some of this along with the ability to turn tentative ideas into physical devices that can put those ideas to the test. The successful practice of physics demands mathematical and mechanical adroitness, persistence, and great imagination. Fortunately, the physicist’s imagination is nourished not just by physics but also by other areas of human enquiry and thought, of the kind that an Ashoka undergraduate is expected to encounter. With all of this in mind, the physics programme has been designed to: (i) allow students wishing to major in physics to discover real physics and make a wise choice, in the first two semesters; (ii) provide a thorough training in fundamental physics, in the following three semesters; and (iii) bring together everything learnt earlier, and give students the option to pursue more advanced courses in physics or branch out into other areas, in the final semester. The idea is to accompany those wishing to become professional physicists as they take the first steps in that direction, and to introduce everyone who goes through the programme to the physicist’s way of thinking.\\xa0   Students wishing to major, minor, or pursue a concentration in Physics are expected to take the introductory course in calculus (Calculus I) offered by the Mathematics Department. Students wishing to major in Physics should plan to take it in their first semester. Mathematical level: All theory courses are calculus-based. The level of mathematical sophistication will increase progressively. The mathematical-physics courses will be application-oriented rather than proof-oriented. A student should have studied Mathematics at the +2 level in school. Those who do not have the requisite mathematics training should take the mathematics Foundation Course and the Calculus course as early as possible. Labs: All lab courses will involve extensive use of instruments to make observations. These experiments will in general illustrate ideas studied in the accompanying theory courses. The use of computers: Many theory courses will include computational exercises, generally using the programming language Python. Labs will also require the use of computers. Duration: Theory courses – Two lectures a week each lasting 1.5 hours. Laboratory courses – One 3-hour lab session per week (plus one optional 3-hour lab session for students to complete their work.)    Students wishing to major, minor, or pursue a concentration in Physics are encouraged to take the introductory course in calculus (Calculus I) offered by the Mathematics Department. Students wishing to major in Physics should plan to take it in their first semester. Number of courses required to major in physics: 15. 100 credits (FCs + CCs + Major courses + other courses). Of these, the 13 courses of the core curriculum are mandatory, and 2 electives may be chosen of those offered (only level 3000 or above). Students are of course free to take as many of the electives as they wish.   Students wishing to major, minor, or pursue a concentration in Physics are encouraged to take the introductory course in calculus (Calculus I) offered by the Mathematics Department.\\xa0 Number of courses required to minor in physics: 6 (24 credits). Of these the two gateway courses – Mathematical Physics I: Mathematical and Computational Toolkit and Lab 1: An Introduction to Physics through Experiments – are compulsory. At least two more courses should be taken from among the core courses offered in semesters 3, 4, and 5, provided appropriate prerequisites have been satisfied for these courses (recommended courses: Classical Mechanics and Thermal Physics). The remaining two may be either other compulsory or elective courses offered by the Physics Department or cross-listed with Physics, provided appropriate prerequisites have been satisfied. In place of one elective course, a student may take an Independent Study Module (ISM) of equivalent credit.   The Department of Physics also offers a Minor in Astronomy, the requirement for which is six courses (24 credits). Two of these are core courses (compulsory): \\xa0The Physics of the Universe (theory) and Observing the Cosmos (lab). Four other courses are to be chosen from the following seven electives on offer: Cosmic Messengers – I (theory), Cosmic Messengers – II (lab), The Earth and Other Planets, The Violent Universe, Astrophysical and Geophysical Fluid Dynamics, Introduction to General Relativity with Application to Cosmology, and Computational Astrophysics and Geophysics.   Students wishing to major, minor, or pursue a concentration in Physics are encouraged to take the introductory course in calculus (Calculus I) offered by the Mathematics Department.\\xa0 Number of courses required for a concentration in physics: 4 (16 credits). Of these the two gateway courses – Mathematical Physics I: Mathematical and Computational Toolkit and Lab 1: An Introduction to Physics through Experiments – are compulsory. At least two more courses should be taken from among the core courses offered in semesters 3, 4 and 5, provided appropriate prerequisites have been satisfied for these courses.   Semesters 1 and 2: Discovering College-level Physics: Students wishing to major in physics are expected to take, in the first semester, the introductory course in calculus offered by the Mathematics Department. The physics-major sequence begins in semester 2, with two courses, one in theoretical physics and the other in experimental physics. The first purpose of these courses is to provide an experience of undergraduate-level physics on the basis of which a student can decide whether or not to major in physics, i.e. they are gateway courses. The second purpose of these courses is to serve as an introduction to the physicist’s way of thinking about problems and solving them, something that has proved useful not just to physicists but also to those in other disciplines that make use of quantitative methods and experiments, e.g. mathematics, computer science, economics, psychology, and biology. Semesters 3, 4, and 5: The Physics Core: The physics courses in semesters 3, 4, and 5 form the core of the physicist’s undergraduate canon: Mathematical Physics II, Classical Mechanics, Electricity & Magnetism in Light of Relativity, Thermal & Statistical Physics, Oscillations, Waves & Optics, Quantum Mechanics I, and Statistical Mechanics, and three accompanying labs. Anyone majoring in physics is expected to be thorough in these areas. Semester 6: Choosing a Direction and Bringing Physics Together: In semester 6 there will be a required course, The Physics of Matter, that brings together much of the physics learnt in earlier semesters, so that the student leaves with a view of physics as an integrated subject. In addition there will be two more elective courses.   Probability and Statistics, offered by the Department of Mathematics.      Ashoka University’s Department of Physics offers a methodically crafted undergraduate programme to students. Students get expert guidance to launch a career in Research, Innovation & related fields.     Graduating with a Physics degree at Ashoka helps in improving one’s inquisitive qualities backed with the ability to come up with ideas and experiment on those. The Physics labs are my absolute favourite as they provide students with the freedom to work on the lab experiments with their own methods which helps in a better understanding of the subject and one can see many innovations take place. There definitely were moments where everything seems just too difficult to complete but once you are through, there’s no better a feeling. I feel anyone who has graduated with a Physics degree at Ashoka may not remember every formula, every equation for the rest of their lives but it gives them the confidence to take on anything that comes ahead no matter how difficult it may seem.

The students majoring in Chemistry as well as those who are interested or doing minor, both will get benefit from this course. Meticulous understanding of chemistry for any students is the focus of th is syllabus.  Chemistry is involved in everything we do. Even if y ou are not chemist, every time you cook, bake, use the washing powder, toothpaste or taking medicine, you are dealing with chemicals . The study of Chemist ry provides a molecular level of description as well as insights into chemical bonding and give you a perfect picture of bond breaking and forming, overall a reaction. At Ashoka, our objective is to teach Chemistry in an integrative and holistic manner connecting with other branches of science, physics, biology, computer and environmental science . We are constantly trying to correlate with them and bring out the best int erest of our students. We are very hopeful to be an integrated part of Ashoka University in near future.  Further, the chemistry department is building up to do innovative and current research. This semester we have no lab course officially, but students interested to do any chemical reaction studying in theory class are always welcome and perform under the monitoring of professor s. The chemistry research requires to have a very sound knowledge on the basic of chemistry and our target is to build you up as an aspiring researcher through the basic concept of organic, inorganic and physical chemistry in this semester. We are very certain that this knowledge will take you further for any field of science or humanities.

About the Department  Philosophy grapples with fundamental questions about the nature of reality, knowledge, and how       we ought to act. Whether in the Indian or Western tradition, answers to these questions have         been supported by rigorous arguments. Our courses offer a historically sensitive immersion in       these arguments. Nevertheless, the philosophy major at Ashoka University aims to equip       students to work beyond the parochialism of either the Indian or Western philosophical tradition        to do philosophy without boundaries.  The philosophy major will equip students with critical reasoning and analytical problem-solving       skills, expressive precision, and the intellectual spaciousness to appreciate and engage rationally       with arguments and points of view with which they profoundly disagree. The Ashoka Philosophy        graduate will be well prepared for higher studies in philosophy or a career in e.g. media, law,         business, or consulting.  People  Current Faculty Members  1.

Symbolic Logic; Category: RC (Offered every monsoon semester) 3. 2 courses (These can be from any of the following categories: HW/IN/CC/EO)**  **The courses cannot be from the same category. For eg: If the first course is from IN, the other          course should be from CC, HW, or EO.  Any students completing a PPE major should complete at least 16 credits in PHI category        courses, that is, they must complete 4 four-credit courses in philosophy.  If a student on a track to completing a PPE major wants to take more courses in philosophy          beyond the minimum requirements, they can do so. The other courses can be from HW, IN, CC,         or EO category. However, such students are advised to get in touch with the PPE department or         their academic advisor to ensure that they are completing all other requirements for the PPE        degree.  A student cannot complete both a PPE major and a minor in philosophy.  FAQs  1. Do I need to take the philosophy courses in some specific order?  Prima facie, no. However, higher-division philosophy courses sometimes have     prerequisites - students are advised to check with the course instructor for such       prerequisites. Moreover, doing philosophy requires rigorous skill in reading a text      closely, writing critically, logical analysis, and sound argumentation. These skills are      often acquired in lower-division courses and it is advisable (but not obligatory) to take        the Introduction to Philosophy and the Symbolic Logic courses before taking      higher-division classes in philosophy.  2. Can I do a thesis before my fourth year (ASP)?  Yes, that is possible. But it will count as an Independent Study Module (ISM).  3. I am not a philosophy major. I want to complete a philosophy thesis in my ASP year. Can          I do so?  Yes, that is possible - all you need to do is find a professor who is willing to supervise          your work. However, it is recommended that you should take some philosophy courses       before doing a thesis.  4. I am taking a philosophy course. I do not know whether it is listed as RC/         IN/HW/CC/EO. How do I find out?  This is easy - just go to the department website page and click on course archive section         ( \\u200b https://www.ashoka.edu.in/page/philosophy-115 \\u200b ).  5. Is there a possibility to get a waiver for any of my degree requirements?  Yes, there is a possibility. You need to discuss with your academic advisor and the Head         of the Department of Philosophy.  6. My question is not listed here. Whom should I approach?

      "{'metadata': None, 'page_content': ' 1 POLITICAL SCIENCE HANDBOOK     GUIDELINES FOR STUDENTS MONSOON 2020   2 Department of Political Science The undergraduate program of Political Science at Ashoka University aims to equip students with the ability to detect, critically analyse and reflect on the omnipresence of the “political” in the world we live in. Through a comprehensive grounding in the foundations of the discipline, we shall examine the natur e, distribution and dynamics of power – both at the macro level of national and international politics and also at the micro level of the individual, family and community. We will map the ways in which knowledge systems and challenges to particular power r elations have been constructed over specific vectors of time and space. We will study both Aristotle and Plato, Gandhi and Iqbal; complementing studies on comparative politics with an exploration of South Asia politics. The Political Science undergraduate curriculum at Ashoka exposes students early on to research methodologies, both qualitative (the ethnographic methods and qualitative modes of political analysis) and quantitative (statistics, political data handling, data visualization). Some of our course s put a lot of emphasis on experiential learning through fieldwork and field trips. Faculty Members : ● Ali Khan Mahmudabad ● Bann Seng Tan ● Gilles Verniers ● Malvika Maheshwari ● Matthew Baxter ● Madhav Khosla ● Neelanjan Sircar ● Pratap Bhanu Mehta ● Vinay Sitapati (Head of Department) ● Priyamvada Trivedi (Visiting)  Requirements for Major: Each student will take a total of 12 courses towards the major. For completing a major in Political Science, one must take the following courses (4 required courses +8 electives):  ● Western Political Thoughts (I) or Introduction to Political Theory ● Introduction to Comparative Politics ● Introduction to Indian Politics ● Quantitative Research Methods or Qualitative Research Methods ● Eight electives in Political Science (including a maximum of three cross -listed courses)   3 Requirements for Minor: Each student will take a total of 6 courses towards the minor. For completing a minor, a student has to take the following courses (3 required courses +3 electives):  ● Western Po litical Thoughts (I) or Introduction to Political Theory ● Introduction to Comparative Politics ● Introduction to Indian Politics ● Three electives in Political Science (including a maximum of 2 cross -listed courses)  Requirements for Concentration:  Each student will take a total of 4 courses towards the concentration. For completing a concentration, a student has to take any two of the required courses and two other electives (2 required courses + 2 electives):  ● Two required courses o ther than the methods’ courses ● Two electives in Political Science (including a maximum of 1 cross -listed course)  Requirements for Major in Politics and Society:  A student needs to take a total of sixteen courses, out of which one needs to take eight courses in Political Science. Out of those eight, four courses are mandatory, while rest four will be electives (4 required courses + 4 electives). The required courses from the Political Science side are:  ● Western Political Thoughts (I) or Introduction to Political Theory ● Introduction to Comparative Politics ● Introduction to Indian Politics ● Quantitative Research Methods or Qualitative Research Methods (in either Sociology & Anthropology or Political Science) ● Four electives in Political Science (including a maximum of 2 cross -listed courses)  Requirements for Major in Politics, Philosophy and Economics (PPE):  Each student needs to take a total of sixteen courses, out of which one needs to take a minimum of four courses in Political Science. If a student takes a minimum of eight courses in Political Science, then it would qualify for a Degree in PPE with a speci alization in Political Science. The mandatory courses from the Political Science side are (3 + 1/5):  ● Western Political Thoughts (I) or Introduction to Political Theory ● Introduction to Comparative Politics ● Introduction to Indian Politics ● One elective in Political Science (4)/Five electives in Political Science (8)  4 Note: In case of 4 courses in Political Science, a student can take a maximum of 1 cross -listed course. In case of 8 courses in Political Science, a student can take a maximum of 2 cross - listed courses.  Structure for the ASPs (4th Years):  For obtaining an Advanced Diploma in Political Science, students need to submit an initial statement of interest in April in their 3rd year, with the name of the preferred advisor(s). This state ment of interest should approximately be of two pages, highlighting preliminary details about the project. By the beginning of the ensuing summer break, students will be matched to an advisor, who may assist in structuring a thesis project over the summer.  In the first week of courses in the Monsoon semester of the 4th year, students will be expected to submit a thesis proposal that is 3000 -5000 words. These proposals will be assessed by the appointed advisor and a department -selected second reader (who is not an advisor) for quality, feasibility and clarity. Students will be given feedback on the proposal by the second week of courses, with one of three decisions: (i) reject , (ii) revise and resubmit , or (iii) pass . If the student is given a pass, then she or he may continue to the thesis program without qualification. If the student is given a revise and resubmit , then she or he may continue to the thesis program conditional on completing the requested revisions within one week. If the student is given a reject , then she or he may not continue into the thesis program.  Upon gaining entry into the thesis program, there are four requirements for the year:  • Attendance at a Year -Long Thesis Semin ar • End of Monsoon Semester Presentation • Final Thesis Presentation (End of Spring Semester) • Final Thesis Submission  The grading scheme across these requirements and relevant schedules will be shared with students before course enrollment commences for the Monsoon Semester. The final thesis will be graded by the advisor(s) and a department -selected second reader (who is not an advisor).  The thesis will be for 8 credits overall (4 in each semester). Students are expected to take at least three courses (12 credits) in Political Science during their advanced ma jor. They can also choose to TA for Political Science courses instead of an elective and gain credits. Beware that TAships are either for 2 credits or 4 credits so make sure that your credits tally properly. The number of credits for TAship is determined b y the faculty before the term. The department advises students to TA for only one course in a semester.  Additionally, each student will be provided a fixed research budget, which can be claim ed upon incurring the expenses. Additional budget can be provided upon request to the advisor and the Head of the Department.   5 Course Levels and Pre -requisites :  Generally, the 100 level courses are entry -level or introductory courses, while the 300 level courses are advanced. The department doesn’t impose a sequence of course as per the level, but strongly recommends that you clear entry -level courses before takin g advanced level courses. Some advanced electives will require you to take Quantitative Research Methods as a prerequisite.  For example (non -exhaustive list):  ● Quantitative Research Methods 2 : Students must have completed Quantitative Research Methods 1. ● Theoretical Political Economy : Students should have completed Quantitative Research Methods 1. They should have either completed or be enrolled in Quantitative Research Methods 2. ● Empirical Political Economy : Students should have completed Quantitative Re search Methods 1. They should have either completed or be enrolled in Quantitative Research Methods 2.  In the event that a course apart from these has some pre -requisites, it will be communicated at the starting of the semester.   Frequently Asked Questions  Q1: What are the compulsory courses for a Political Science major?  1. Western Political Thought I or Introduction to Political Theory 2. Introduction to Indian Politics 3. Introduction to Comparative Politics 4. Quantitative or Qualitative Research Metho ds  Q2: What are the compulsory courses for a Political Science minor?  1. Western Political Thought I or Introduction to Political Theory 2. Introduction to Indian Politics 3. Introduction to Comparative Politics  Q3: Is there a sequence in which I should take the required courses?  No. Q4: How many 100/200/300 level courses do I need to take?  6 There is no such requirement to take a specific number of courses of each level. Only the required courses are mandatory and can be taken in any sequence, irrespective of levels.  Q5: I’m going on a semester abroad. Can I substitute the required courses with a summer abroad course?  No. Required courses cannot be not substituted by summer courses.  Q6: Are Political Ideologies and WPT II compulsory courses?  No. Q7: What if I have done Political Ideologies/Introduction to Political Theory/Dynamics of State Formation in the past as a part of the requirement?  In case you have done Political Ideologies in Spring 2017 or Introduction to Political Theory in Spring 2018, you need not do WPT I. If you have done Dynamics of State Formation with Prof. Vinay Sitapati in the past, you fulfill the requirement for Introduction to Indian Politics. However, if you pursue these courses in any other semester, they will coun t only as electives and not as requirements , except for Introduction to Political Theory .  Q8: Can I take Political Ideologies/Introduction to Political Theory (electives) if I have done WPT I (required course) and vice versa?  Yes. Q9: Is WPT a pre -requ isite for WPT II?  No. We do recommend that you take WPT II after WPT I, but it’s not a pre -requisite.  Q10: Can I take a methods course in any other discipline?  Yes, you can, with validation from Prof. Sircar for quantitative courses and from the HoD for qualitative courses. In any case, you have to inform the HoD, the OAA and the Department Manager about this change.  Q11: How many cross -listed courses can I take?  Cross -listed courses are those courses which arise out of a discipline different from Political Science but are cross -listed with Political Science. Students can take upto two cross -listed course in a ny semester , provided all other rules are satisfied . The following is a summary of the rules around cross -listed courses:  ● Pure Major in Political Science: Maximum 3 ● ID Major in Politics and Society : Maximum 2 ● ID Major in PPE with 8 courses in Political Science: Maximum 2 7 ● ID Major in PPE with 4 courses in Political Science: Maximum 1 ● Concentration in Pol itical Science: Maximum 1 ● Minors in Political Science: Maximum 2  Q12: How can I get a course from another department cross -listed?  Write to the professor teaching that course to express your individual interest. Request the professor to directly email the course syllabus to the Head of Department, Political Science. The department will then take a collective decision , communicate with the professor directly , and then in form the students.  Q 13: I took a course which was cross -listed with Political Science. It is being offered again but is not showing as cross -listed. Is this a problem?  No. It is normal for courses to not be cross -listed with other departments in every semester that they’re offered. If you took a course, which was cross -listed in the semester that you took it, it will count towards your degree. Please cross -check the course code of such courses in your LMS.  Q14: Can I write a thesi s in the third year?  No. Only ASPs can write a thesis with the department. But you can do an ISM (Independent studies Module) with faculty. Some faculty offer ISMs – individual or group -based – others take proposals from students.  Q15: I’m interested in TAing for the Spring semester. How should I proceed?  Only ASP students are eligible to TA for courses. The department notifies all ASPs of TA requirement at the beginning of the semester and calls for applications. But in recent years there has been a scarcity of courses available for TA -ship. So students are advised not to depend upon it.  Q16: Can 4th year students opt out of an advanced major at a later stage  Yes, provided you fulfil other requirements meant for graduation.  Q17: Can students re -take the same course to get a higher grade.  Yes, but this is at the discretion of the professor offering the course. In case the new course is being offered by another professor (for example, because the original professor has left), the decision lies with the professor of the new course.  Q18: Whom should I contact for further queries?  8 You can email them to the Student Representative Vaibhav Parik <vaibhav.parik_asp21@ashoka.edu.in> or the Department Manager Anjali Panwar at anjali.panwar @asho ka.edu.in .

Overview 1.1 Degree Requirements at Ashoka To graduate with a Bachelor’s degree, students are required to pass courses that are broadly divided into three categories – Foundation Courses ,Major Courses (including Interdisciplinary Majors) andCo-Curricular Courses . First year students typically take foundation courses in the ﬁrst 3-4 semesters at Ashoka, and start taking Major courses from the 2nd semester. You also have the option to take up a completely different subject as a minor or a concentration in addition to your major. Minors and Concentrations are brief programs taken in disciplines other than your major. Minors at Ashoka require you to take 6 courses in a discipline, while a concentration requires 4 courses. 1.2 GPA and Credit System Please note that University-wise credit requirements are subject to change, and the latest requirements are always available on the ofﬁcial website . At Ashoka, each course carries credit points - foundation courses as well as major speciﬁc and minor courses typically earn a student 4 credit points , while co-curricular courses give 2 credit points . In order to earn their degree at the end of three years, students pursuing a pure major (such as Computer Science etc.) need to have accumulated a minimum of 100 credits . On the other hand, students pursuing an interdisciplinary major (such as CS and Entrepreneurship etc.) must fulﬁll a minimum of116 credits . A student’s performance in any academic course is graded on a letter scale (ranging from A to F). Each grade carries a grade point (such as an A gives 16 grade points, while an A- gives 14.8). On this basis, at the end of every semester a student’s cumulative grade point average (CGPA) and semester speciﬁc GPA are calculated. For more on this, please refer to the section on Awards and Recognition (3.6).6 Chapter 1. Overview 1.3 CS at Ashoka The Department of Computer Science at Ashoka University acknowledges the increasing relevance of computing and information science to every academic discipline. In addition to classical and emerging areas of Computer Science, students have an opportunity to study interdisciplinary areas like computational biology, social and information networks, digital humanities and data-driven journalism. 2 interdisciplinary majors, a minor, a concentration are also offered by the Department in addition to an undergraduate major in Computer Science and a Ph.D. in Computer Science.

Academic Opportunities 3.1 Complimentary Disciplines Computer Science is a very versatile subject - with applications transcending multiple disciplines. At Ashoka, we have 2 interdisciplinary courses in CS, along with Entrepreneurship and Mathematics. Apart from these, it is also common for students studying CS at Ashoka to enroll in courses from Mathematics, Economics, Physics and Biology. 3.2 Study Abroad Programs Note that, like any other program at Ashoka, the Study Abroad Programs are subject to changes. Kindly refer to the GESP website for the latest information. Additionally, contact the departmental HOD for further clariﬁcation regarding credit transfers Every summer, international summer schools offer undergraduate courses in different subjects and ﬁelds. These courses can be transferred (subject to faculty approval) to the total credits taken as Ashoka. The Ofﬁce of Global Education and Strategic Programmes (GESP) is available to students for assistance and counselling in the application process. Ashoka is currently partnered with Wellesley College, UC Berkeley, University of Pennsyl- vania, Yale University, King’s College London, University of Michigan, Penn Engineering, Sciences Po, and Trinity College Dublin . Students can also apply for research and internship opportunities abroad to get practical experience in their ﬁelds of interest through a competitive process. These opportunities are available in Lehigh University, NTU Singapore, Koç University etc. For any enquiries on the process of applying for a summer/semester abroad, kindly email studyabroad@ashoka.edu.in 3.3 Teaching Assistantships As a TF/TA, you would be responsible for grading quizzes, holding discussion sessions and doubt clearing ofﬁce hours, as well as helping with the logistics for classes. A prospective applicant can12 Chapter 3. Academic Opportunities apply to TA for only those courses which they have already studied in Ashoka in the past. While preference may be given to seniors, anyone is welcome to apply for TAship by approaching the professor directly. Some courses may have different procedures, so do conﬁrm it with the instructor. 3.4 Independent Study Modules (ISM) Independent Study Modules (ISM) are 4-credit research projects that provide students an opportunity to work closely with a faculty member. These projects can either be research that faculty members are already working on or any other research topic that students may be interested in. If interested, you can simply approach a faculty member through email prior to the start of the semester, requesting them for guidance through an ISM. These count towards your electives. 3.5 Research Opportunities with Professors If you are interested in CS Research, it is a great idea to start working as a Research Assistant (RA) under a faculty member. In order to do so, you will have to personally approach faculty members in their ofﬁce hours and enquire whether you can assist them on current projects. Before seeking RA roles, make sure to have prior knowledge about the research interests of your faculty member. The CS Society also has plans of creating a uniﬁed Undergraduate Research Opportunities Platform to ease out this process. 3.6 Awards and Recognition •Dean’s List: The Dean’s List at Ashoka for any given semester includes the names of all students who, in the courses they have taken that semester, have scored a GPA of 3.65 or above.

CS Clubs and Societies 4.2 Women in Computing Society (WiCS) Founded by an Ashoka alumnus, Simran Bhuria, and launched on campus by Mrs. Rashmi Mohan, an ACM eminent speaker on 29th September 2016, Women in Computing Society is a small bunch of passionate students working towards making the CS culture at Ashoka a safer, healthier, and inclusive one. We also focus on supporting everyone in CS, especially womxn, academically and personally. We constantly work towards building a larger community of womxn in CS that is collaborative and supportive in nature. As an academic society, we organise talks, hackathons, cryptic hunts, workshops, problem-solving centered stalls and events, and reading groups. As a part of our larger vision of an inclusive community, we organise events focused on activism – blog posts, discussions on gender in academic spaces and sexism, sessions on building conﬁdence and tackling other challenges for womxn in STEM and movie screenings! 1.WiCS cryptic hunts: We have had multiple hunts since the inception of WiCS based on different themes in collaboration with other societies such as – Ashoka’s Philosophy Society, Ashoka’s Psychology Society, Sandhi (Ashoka’s Languages Society), Ashoka Society for Politics, etc. 2.Workshops: These are focused on tools and skills useful for students in CS and beyond. We have done workshops on Git, web development, programming for beginners (Programming without Code), Excel/Google Sheets etc. 3.Interactive sessions: Some of the sessions we have organised in the past: a session with Prof. Jennifer Widom, Stanford University at Ashoka (2018), a Capstone Student Panel Discussion with senior students and alumni, an open house for CS students focused on discussions around gender in academic spaces, mixers for CS womxn. 4.Problem-solving centered stalls at fests and Haats: These were our attempts at sharing the joy of solving puzzles and love for algorithms with others at Ashoka. 5.Hackathons, collaborative work sessions focused on competitive programming, and unwinding sessions. Reach out to us at wics@ashoka.edu.in. 4.3 Special CS Events •CS Mixer: The CS Mixer is a unique initiate undertaken by the Department of CS every year, intended primarily to introduce the CS freshers to the seniors and members of the faculty. It is a fun event where you get to interact with all the faculty members, seek quick advice, all while enjoying free food! •Mahavamsa: Mahavamsa is Ashoka’s ﬁrst coding contest. It is a 48 hour coding contest with lots of cash prizes to be won. The contest is open to all current students of Ashoka University. Beginners and non-CS majors are also encouraged to participate. All you need is basic programming knowledge in a language of your choice! The ﬁrst edition of Mahavamsa was held in Spring 2020 and the CS Society intends to make it a recurring event.5.

Computer Science, goes the joke (hint: they’re not joking), has little to do with com- puters and is not really a science. If you really push me, I’d say that it is a study of processes, of understanding why and how things happen, and their inherent complexity: is one problem truly harder than another? E.g., is it more difﬁcult to ﬁnd a square root than a 3rd root? Why? (Maybe there’s an easy trick for one and we’re just being stupid.) Personally, I love this subject because it’s the closest thing to magic we have. We create our incantations (computer programs), prepare the appropriate sacriﬁces (sleep is the common currency used by undergraduates, I believe), and wave our wands (or macbooks dual-booting linux): our spells can travel across the world across the only planetary-scale infrastructure ever built by humanity, jumping across chains of electrons and photons in a system that stores (nearly) the sum total of human knowledge (and ignorance). Our spells can analyse your iris and detect diabetes well before any medical doctor could, and also tell the hospital how to best optimise their supplies; they can navigate our spacecraft across unimaginable distances and help us understand the universe; they can connect us all through social media and buoy industry through a pandemic via e-commerce. There’s a dark side as well - all things can be misused. I hope to teach you a lot about computer science. But I don’t just want well-trained worker bees: I want brilliant, nuanced thought; I want technical knowledge balanced by moral ﬁbre; but most of all, I want each and every one of you to become the very best human beings you can be (that, and understand pointers properly). PS. Yes, computer scientists tend to use more parentheses than most other people (and what’s wrong with that?). -Debayan Gupta , Assistant Professor, Ashoka University5.3 Post-Ashoka Journey 17 5.2.2 Book/ Resource Recommendation Textbooks/ Reference books recommended by Faculty: 1.Introduction to Algorithms by Cormen, Leiserson, Rivest, and Stein 2.The C Programming Language by Kernighan and Ritchie 3.The C++ Programming Language by Bjarne Stroustrup 4.Database System Concepts by Avi Silberschatz 5.Computational Complexity: A Modern Approach by Barak and Arora 6.Introduction to Modern Cryptography by Katz and Lindell 7.Cryptography and Network Security by Stallings 8.Compilers: Principles, Techniques, and Tools by Aho, Lam, Sethi, and Ullman 9.Artiﬁcial Intelligence: A Modern Approach by Norvig and Russell 10.Computer Networks by Tanenbaum 11.Computer Architecture: A Quantitative Approach by Hennessy and Patterson 12.Modern Processor Design by Shen and Lipasti Other fun reads: 1.Gödel, Escher, Bach by Douglas Hofstadter 2.I am a Strange Loop by Douglas Hofstadter 3.The Art of Computer Programming by Donald E.

Ashoka University offers a 3-month long summer break, which you can utilize productively by interning. It is advisable to search for summer internships at least 2-3 months prior to the start of the break - most ﬁrms or research centers have deadlines that you should research about as early as possible. Moreover, Ashoka University’s Career Development Ofﬁces (CDO) also provide internship opportunities through ﬁrms that recruit interns on campus. If you’re applying through CDO, keep your SuperSet proﬁle updated to avoid last-minute hassle. For CS speciﬁc internships, do occasionally brush up on your Data Structures and Algorithms . 5.3.2 On Letters of Recommendation from Faculty Graduation School applications often require letters of recommendation from faculty during the admissions process. An optimal letter-writer should ideally have you in at least one class or should have supervised you in research, thesis, or other work. Moreover, their contact with you should be relatively recent. You might also want to consider how well you performed in their class or work and whether you have had interactions with them outside of the classroom. Note that different professors may have different rules related to Letters of Recommendation, thus make it a point to get in touch with your desired letter-writer and clarify all details well in advanced. Also, approach the faculty at least 2 weeks in advanced for them to be prepared.18 Chapter 5. Additional Resources and Advice 5.3.3 Alumni Experiences in the Industry Barun Parruck (UG’19) Q:What does your current role at Google India entail? A:I’m a Software Engineer 2 at Google, speciﬁcally an iOS full stack developer within the Google One team. My day to day work involves ﬁxing bugs assigned to me, proposing and implementing new features, and writing unit tests for these features. Q:You were active on competitive programming websites. How helpful do you think that was in helping you secure an internship at Microsoft and the subsequent job offer? A:They were perhaps the main feature of how I got the internship. Getting the job offer from the internship was a completely different task, and primarily involved making extensive contributions to their codebase and presenting and demo’ing my additions constantly over the period of the internship. Q:During your time at Ashoka, what were your favorite courses? Other than Program- ming, what area of CS intrigued you the most? A:Software Debugging is probably the most useful course I’ve ever taken. Most of my interest lies in either algorithmic problem solving or full stack web development and software architecture. My favourite course was Databases and Data Mining (Debapriyo Majumdar), followed closely by Computer Organization and Systems (Vivek Seshadri) Q:Any pitfalls one should avoid while studying CS at Ashoka? A:Avoid taking too many courses (though deﬁnitely attend a single class of every single course, just in case you’re missing out on some exceptional professors). I think a lot of people get caught up with the idea that the goal is the submission of the assignment. I’ve had bad grades now and then - but I’ve tried my best to make sure that every assignment submitted wasn’t for the submission but for the content. And start early! :P Q:What advice would you give to undergraduates who wish to join the industry? A:Deﬁnitely I’d say you need to focus on getting your interviews right. I seem to do pretty well in traditional SWE interviews and a large part of that comes from my competitive programming background, as well as just grinding leetcode and practicing mock interviews a lot. If you don’t interview often, it’s quite likely that stress will act up and cause you to perform subpar. And reach out to seniors, professors, anybody - connections are important in the industry re: getting referrals. Participate in all the popular company recruitment drives like the Facebook Hacker cup, or the Google Code jam/kickstarter. And ﬁnally, you can always reach out to recruiters on Linkedin if you’ve got a decent proﬁle to be able to bring a more personal touch to the applications you make Barun Parruck is a Software Engineer at Google Inc. He was formerly a Software Engineer at Microsoft where he had also interned in his junior year. As a student, Barun was very active on competitive programming websites like Codeforces5.3 Post-Ashoka Journey 19 Nishka Dasgupta (ASP’19) Q:What does your current role at Microsoft Research Lab, India entail? A:I work as a Research Fellow. Under the guidance of my manager, I am currently trying to develop efﬁcient protocols in Multiparty Computation (MPC). Q:What do you think, helped you secure your current role? A:Both my previous summer internships had been research-focused, speciﬁcally on cryptography projects, so that certainly played a factor. By fortunate coincidence, my most recent internship before I applied had been in multiparty computation (MPC), and the manager whom I applied to work with was also interested in MPC at the time, so our research interests aligned. Having strong recommendations also helped. Q:How should one prepare for job/internship searches? A:While not every role will have the same requirements, there are some general best practises that have helped me. Cover your bases before any interview or exam; a lot of interviews, even for speciﬁc roles, often expect a breadth of basic knowledge anyway. Be prepared to network and ﬁnd out which of your professors (especially professors who have a positive impression of you) knows someone who knows someone who works at your dream company/university. Talk to your seniors, batchmates and professors as well, to learn about opportunities you would not have heard of otherwise (that’s how I learned about the RF programme at MSR). Don’t take rejection personally; focus on learning from your mistakes. Try not to bluff too hard about your interest or knowledge regarding any ﬁeld/professor unless you are prepared to put in the work until you really are as dedicated/knowledgeable as you claimed to be. Q:Any pitfalls one should avoid while studying CS at Ashoka? A:As most of the professors don’t really impose a speciﬁc language, it can be easy to get too comfortable with only one language. This is a mistake. Look for excuses to learn new languages or frameworks that you are not being forced to learn in a class, especially those popularly used in your preferred ﬁeld (e.g most big crypto projects are written in C/C++) or in the industry at large. Python is delightful up until your job interviewer asks you questions about memory errors in C. Although mathematics courses are not compulsory for CS at Ashoka, some ﬁelds (and grad schools) will expect certain courses (e.g a Linear Algebra requirement for AI focused programmes; a Number Theory requirement for theoretical crypto). If you have a preferred ﬁeld, do your research on what is needed (talk to relevant professors too) and plan your courses accordingly. Q:Any advice for undergraduates about the Industry? A:Long working hours are, unfortunately, the norm, whether in research or in development. Especially near deadlines, sleep can be hard to come by. So, start working on your ability to handle stress. In research speciﬁcally, you will often be expected to take the lead and start making suggestions instead of waiting for your mentor to tell you what to do next; if you have trouble with that, start practising. Nishka is a Research Fellow at Microsoft Research Labs, India. She has interned at Nanyang Technlogical University - Singapore, and Tata Institute of Fundamental Research - Mumbai, as an undergraduate researcher.20 Chapter 5. Additional Resources and Advice 5.3.4 Alumni Experiences in Higher Education Anavi Kajla (ASP’18) Q:You pursued your Masters in Human-Computer Interaction. How good a ﬁeld, in your opinion, is HCI for someone who wants to study Computer Science in sync with the Humanities? A:HCI is a highly interdisciplinary ﬁeld and can draw from virtually any discipline. A degree in CS and then going into HCI is highly beneﬁcial because you have a deeper understanding of software development and various technical constraints. Ultimately, any job in UX will involve a high degree of communicating with developers about the designs you create and knowing how they work gives you an advantage. Q:You have also interned at Amazon. What skills do such companies look for while hiring students who specialize in UI/UX? Do Data Structure and Algorithm skills take prece- dence? Or are Software Engineers who work on UI/UX projects evaluated differently? A:There are 4 paths someone interested in UI/UX can take: UX Designer, UX Engineer, Visual Designer and UX Researcher. Skills & evaluation depends on which role you’re interested in and usually doesn’t require knowledge of CS concepts we’re taught in our major. I would highly recommend looking up these specializations for a more in-depth understanding of what each role entails and where your interests/strengths lie. There are skills common to all these that employers typically look for: a portfolio of projects (super important!), storytelling skills, creative problem-solving and the ability to communicate well with others. In my case, I was exclusively an SDE and didn’t have much of a UI/UX component in my internship apart from working on a small front-end project. Q:What parameters would you advise an undergrad at Ashoka to focus on, if they wish to pursue graduate studies in Human-Computer Interaction? A:Since most CS classes at Ashoka have a project component in them, it would be beneﬁcial if students could go and talk to actual users of the product they’re building and get feedback on it! This would help them understand the importance/role of UX in product development and also, make for a great portfolio project. Apart from that, getting familiar with various prototyping tools (eg. Sketch, Figma) is a great place to start developing interaction & visual design skills. Some of these tools also offer students free plans! And, front-end skills are a bonus too. Q:Are there any pitfalls one should avoid while studying CS at Ashoka? A:The Ashoka CS department has grown a lot since I graduated and students should take advantage of the variety of classes offered to develop their interests. When I was attending, my batchmates & I would take whichever course was offered so we could complete our major! It didn’t afford us the ﬂexibility to take classes that we were genuinely interested in. Apart from one introductory HCI class in my second year, I wasn’t able to study more topics in the ﬁeld. But now hopefully you can!5.3 Post-Ashoka Journey 21 Q:What advice would you give to undergraduates who wish to eventually join the industry in a similar ﬁeld? A: –Try to involve users in your class projects early to get a feel of the work you’ll be doing as a UXer –Working on a portfolio takes time, so start early! (look here for inspiration) –Research the ﬁeld and it’s many specializations well before you decide to take the leap - it’s not for everyone Anavi is currently a product designer at the Library of Congress - USA. She pursued her Masters in Human Computer Interaction from the University of Maryland-College Park. She has also interned at Amazon as a Software Development Engineer Pratyush Ranjan Tiwari (ASP’20) Q:What are your current research interests? A:My main research area of interest is cryptography. My areas of interests within cryptography are veriﬁable computation, quantum cryptography, privacy-preserving techniques and funda- mentals of cryptography. I am particularly interested in designing protocols with minimal trust requirements. Q:What undergraduate research that you have undertaken are you the proudest of? A:Two main projects: a) Is the paper I published at IEEE Security and Privacy on the Blockchain titled CryptoWills, which is a protocol for secure and private last wills for cryptocurrencies. This allows for people’s funds in cryptocurrencies to be distributed to their loved ones after they passed away, this is a ﬁrst protocol solving that problem. b) Security & Privacy and attacks on Aadhaar: I worked on this with a big team of people at Ashoka under Prof. Debayan Gupta. My personal contribution was towards the cryptography used in Aadhaar, I devised the biggest attack on Aadhaar till date. The paper is embargoed and we are awaiting govt. permission to publish. Q:Any pitfalls one should avoid while studying CS at Ashoka? A:Don’t do things because other people think they’re cool. Find out for yourself if working for a big tech company will actually be your dream job. Since Ashoka is new and we don’t really get the FAANG companies to visit and hire, people at Ashoka CS often develop this fantasy for such jobs. Do internships to ﬁgure out what a career in a particular direction is like, do an internship with some startup in Bangalore/some other city in India (and abroad too if you can) to ﬁnd out what it’s like living that life. Intern at a university in India (and abroad too if you can) to ﬁgure out what life in academia is like. Bottomline, whatever possible career trajectories you want to try out, do that a lot, even if it costs you some grades (tbh, don’t drop below 3.5 tho).Start looking for internships for the next summer from August, ask professors to connect you with people. After the summer before 4th year you can basically have a plan then on what to do next. Finding jobs/grad schools etc. will take a year and thats’ what the22 Chapter 5. Additional Resources and Advice 4th year is for. Try different dept. at Ashoka and their courses, doing interdisciplinary things opens new doors career wise. Only work with people you enjoy working with. Don’t fall into the classic CS stereotype, and be healthy, well rounded and don’t let your major be your identity. Q:How should one prepare for Grad School applications? A:Once you know you’re applying the most important aspects are 1.Published papers/pre-prints : Pre-prints are fully written papers which are not yet accepted for publishing. This is the easiest foot-in-the-door from the perspective of admission committees. If you don’t have this yet, I would suggest getting at least a pre-print worthy research idea, working on it and then applying. 2.Recommendation: Only ask people who will recommend you 110% positively, make you look awesome. Try to get someone very successful in your research area/ﬁeld to write a rec, this person should be preferably from outside Ashoka. The way to do this is to get internships with people like this and then working super hard to impress them. 3.Grades: Sorry but yes, the higher your grades the better your chances in general. However, everything above a 3.8 is the same. The big brackets I would say are a) 3.8+ b) 3.5+ c) 3.2+ d) apply later. In case of d) do something awesome to stand out, like publish a paper at a top venue to stand out, work somewhere popular, get a recommendation from someone who is super popular in the ﬁeld and only then apply. Or go to an okayish place for a Master’s and then improve. Q:Any advice for undergraduates about the higher studies in CS? A:If you haven’t done any research, then don’t go to grad school. Only go to grad school if you’ve worked on research problems, and know that you want to take advanced courses and also do more research. Don’t go if you’re unsure/ because don’t have anything else lined up. Ideally you should pay 0 for grad school, and arguably go only when you don’t have to pay. Pratyush is a passionate cryptographer, pursuing his PhD from John Hopkins University. He was also accepted to NYU’s Courant School of Mathematics. His internship experience includes research roles at Indian Institute of Technology-Madras, Chennai Mathematical Institute, Dunya Labs, and Celo-Berlin.5.3 Post-Ashoka Journey 23 Vineet Reddy (ASP’20) Q:You were accepted to some very reputed departments like NYU Tandon and UChicago. What path did you tread as an undergraduate that helped you secure these? A:I think having a solid research/project experience in your undergrad really sets you apart from other students. Keep in mind that Ashoka CS still does not have the same reputation as that of other programs in India (think IIT’s IIIT’s and BITS). I think focusing on this can be really useful when one is applying to graduate programs. Also, developing good rapport with your professors helps as you’ll need their references when you start applying. Q:According to you, what sets someone apart when applying to universities for a Masters in CS? A:From what our professors have told me - SoP and your LoRs seem to matter, by far, the most. While your GPA is important, most of the time, it your SoP and LoRs that set you apart from every other applicant. Stufﬁng them with solid references and good content should really help. Q:What is the next ’big’ thing you aspire to achieve? A:Ideally, work as a Software Developer in one of the Big 4 tech companies. Something long term would be to retire as soon as possible! Trust me, slogging off at work sucks. Q:Any pitfalls one should avoid while studying CS at Ashoka? A:One of the biggest pitfalls I noticed coming from an engineering program was how the education for most CS majors ends with the classroom. Most of the stuff I picked up was by doing random side projects and messing around with some popular libraries. Don’t just do what your courses tell you to, pick up random stuff and just work on it – you’ll probably learn a lot more than what your courses teach. Q:Any advice for undergraduates about the higher studies in CS? A:Work hard in Discrete Math and Algorithms! They’re super important courses that I should have paid a lot more attention to. Don’t worry too much about your grades, they’ll be ﬁne as long as you put in a bit of effort. Don’t just be a one trick pony – learn more than Python. Most of all, enjoy your time at Ashoka, it’s going to be great. Vineet is a Machine Learning Enthusiast, and was accepted to Masters programs at the New York University, University of Chicago, University of Massachusetts Amherst, and University of Maryland. Due to the ongoing COVID-19 crisis, he has decided to defer his admit to the next year. He’s currently working as a software development engineer at EACIIT - a Singapore based Big Data Analytics leader.24 Chapter 5. Additional Resources and Advice Aditya Singh (ASP’20) Q:What is the most important advice you would give juniors who wish to get into top Masters programs? A:I think the most important thing is to actively engage with the material and faculty while taking courses. Before making the decision to apply for further studies, it’s important to be clear about what one would like to study further. Personally, being involved in various different projects helped me in identifying the areas I really wanted to focus on and pursue further. Q:According to you, which aspect of your application was most instrumental in you getting accepted into top universities? A:Applying for postgraduate studies is a pretty holistic process so pinpointing one single aspect is difﬁcult. I think having industry exposure along with some research experience is helpful as it shows versatility, which then also reﬂects in the recommendations. Doing decently well on standardized tests is essential as they act as a virtual cutoff for some universities. The statement of purpose is also as important as anything else and should be thoroughly reviewed. Q:Any pitfalls one should avoid while studying CS at Ashoka? A:I can’t say in general, but in my experience, I found that it’s easy to become a little disconnected and solely grade obsessed at Ashoka, which is a detrimental mindset to have. Making the effort to interact and grow with not only your professors, but also your peers, goes a long way in helping you get the most out of the time you spend here. Q:How would you compare research experience and industry internships when it comes to applying to Masters programs in grad schools? A:I think it really depends on the sort of programs and universities one is targeting. For more theoretical and research-based programs I emphasized my research experience with professors at Ashoka and outside, whereas for programs that are also directed towards the industry (like data science, information systems, etc.) I put more emphasis on the internships. The recommendation letters also varied correspondingly. Again, it’s helpful to identify the area one would like to pursue, and plan the summer/winter commitments accordingly. Q:As you will be studying Computational Data Science at CMU, what is the most impor- tant skill people interested in Data Science must cultivate? A:I think the most important skill to cultivate would be to keep your fundamentals in mathematics strong, especially in subjects like linear algebra and real analysis. One might be able to intuitively understand how CNNs look for features across visual data, but knowing how the process of Stochastic Gradient Descent works is as important. Aditya plans to attend Carnegie Mellon University for an MS in Computational Data Science. He was also accepted to other reputed universities like University of Massachusetts-Amherst and University of Maryland.

The general syntax of one’s email is <ﬁrstname>.<lastname>_<batch>@ashoka.edu.in and you can use this format to look up/ contact anyone at Ashoka. Keep in mind that if one has multiple active email addresses, you will need to use your discretion, as follows: –If one has separate aspandugemails, contact them on their latest email (i.e aspin this case). Similarly, contact alumni on their alumni email ID. –Contact your TAs and TFs on their TA IDs, and not their personal emails, for course- related queries - makes their lives easier •If you do now know who to contact for anything remotely related to Computer Science, you should probably contact the CS Representative ﬁrst.

Symmetry is a fundamental concept throughout physics, be it particle physics and field theory, condensed matter physics, cosmology, quantum mechanics/quantum information or atomic and molecular physics. The basic concepts of geometrical symmetry,\\xa0 finite groups and their representations will be covered. A physically oriented\\xa0 introduction will be given to Lie algebras and Lie groups and their representations. The emphasis throughout will be on the particular rather than the general. Familiar concepts from quantum mechanics will be used repeatedly - for example, the hydrogen atom spectrum and its symmetries will arise repeatedly during the study of Lie groups. Rather than develop the general theory of semi-simple compact Lie groups, the important concepts will be illustrated through particular examples. For example, the groups SO(2), SO(3), SU(2), SU(3) etc. as they arise in physics and their unique and distinctive features and representations.\\xa0 Pre-requisites: Quantum Mechanics References: Group theory in a nutshell for physicists, by A.

We will begin by formulating the primary concepts: the laws of motion and the dynamical equations as differential equations which need to be integrated to find the solutions of mechanical problems. We will stress the importance of conservation laws not only in the solution of otherwise intractable dynamical problems but also their wider scope beyond Newtonian dynamics. As applications we will deal with central force motion and the harmonic oscillator. Besides their historical importance, these are rich and instructive examples illustrating the basic concepts. The second part of the course deals with Analytical Mechanics: We will make the transition from newtonian to lagrangian dynamics by introducing the notion of generalised co-ordinates. The variational principle is then introduced as a unified way of dealing with diverse physical problems. Lagrange’s equations are re-derived and the transition to the hamiltonian form of dynamics is made thereby introducing the concept of phase space - a notion of special importance in statistical mechanics. Subsequently, the Poisson bracket formulation would be discussed. Throughout we will stress the importance of, and the connections between, symmetry principles and conservation laws. This course would be a stepping stone for later courses in quantum and statistical mechanics. It should also enable you to later study more advanced topics in classical physics like fluid mechanics, non-linear dynamical systems and chaos.

The BSc (Hons.) programme in Chemistry offers the fundamental knowledge of how Chemistry shapes the entire universe. Chemistry is at the centre of everything. The study of Chemistry provides the synthetic skills of making molecules and materials and\\xa0 a molecular level of description and insights into chemical bonding, as to why a bond breaks and a new bond is formed. At Ashoka, our objective is to teach Chemistry in an integrative and holistic manner connecting with other branches of science, physics, biology, and material chemistry.\\xa0 Ashoka undergraduate program in chemistry is quite different from the standard Chemistry programs at this level. It will raise the inquisitiveness and help prepare the students to tackle the real world problems.    Opportunity to do Research Projects: Students will have opportunities to work on research projects alongside the PhD scholars in the department. Students can learn advance analytical/synthetic techniques. Will also get hands on experience of sample preparation and characterization using various instruments such as NMR, Fluorimeter, Cyclic Voltammetry and GC-MS etc.\\xa0 As a long term objective, the department seeks to promote the spirit of entrepreneurship, translation of many of the researches in the above areas for societal needs and connection with industries related to the above areas   The Department of Chemistry has created an elaborate curriculum which includes Organic, Inorganic and Physical Chemistry.

Requirements: Students are expected to take 14 courses to earn their major in Chemistry. Of these, the course break-up is as follows: Gateway Courses 7 Core Courses 4 Lab Courses 3 Electives Up to 3 cross-listed courses from another department can count towards the major. *The Critical Thinking Seminar is a mandatory requirement for batches from the Undergraduate Batch of 2023. Previous batches can count a CTS towards their requirements, but they are not required to do so. Instead, they can fulfill their requirements by taking another 1000/2000-level elective.   Students from different department are always encouraged to take chemistry as their minor. The knowledge will help a student to understand the science in our everyday life. This will also help to become a better researcher in any field of science. We believe it’s a great opportunity for a liberal university student. Requirements: To complete a minor in Chemistry, a student must do 6 courses: This can include direct course offered from chemistry department or cross-listed (if any) with the department. 4 theory courses and any 2 electives can be chosen to complete a minor in Chemistry. Lab courses can be also considered as a minor subject.

Hear from Prof. Sourav Pal, Visiting Professor of Chemistry, and Isha Singhal, Chemistry Major (Batch of 22) on the unique ways in which Chemistry is taught at Ashoka. At Ashoka, our objective is to teach Chemistry in an integrative and holistic manner connecting with other branches of science such as physics, biology, and material chemistry. The main aim of the department is to integrate interdisciplinary research with teaching.         No, it’s a core course. Any Minor also can take lab course.   All labs are stand-alone courses and mandatory for Chemistry major students. They each count for the same number of credits as theory courses.   Only for ASP students.   Yes. But it is recommended that you stay for a 4th year.   We haven’t decided about TA in Chemistry course.   Yes. But prior to take the courses please contact with the respective professors or HOD Prof. Sourav Pal.   Has not been decided yet.   Electives are offered at 300 level. You can choose to do any 3 for a major and 2 for a minor and 1 for concentration. There is no minimum limit.   As of now, the Chemistry department is not offering any cross listed subjects. For future information please talk to Prof. Sourav Pal or Dr. Munmun Ghosh.\\xa0   We are investing in the idea of the 4th year as a time when undergraduates delve into research in a serious year-long way. In addition, there are several summer opportunities for science and undergraduates can approach labs of their interest in Ashoka in order to start doing research whenever they would like as their undergraduate degree progresses. We encourage students to take small projects with the professors in any time of the year.   We are interested in specializing in various areas of Chemistry as well as some interface area with biology and chemistry. Material science, Inorganic chemistry, Bioinorganic chemistry, computational chemistry are the few such mentioned fields, chemistry department are offering for research.   The 3-year degree you get if you specialize in Chemistry would be a B.Sc. However, the additional qualification you get for the fourth year would be named as per the norms of the State Government.

      "* Calculus is a mandatory course for all Mathematics majors and minors. Students are required to take a minimum of 3 Elective + courses preferably in their 5th and 6th semester.\n",
      "* Courses marked * are mandatory for Mathematics minors. For a Concentration in Mathematics one needs to do courses marked # and one more course of their choice, provided prerequisites are met.\n",

      "**Frequently asked questions**\n",
      "\n",
      "**Q: Is the 1000/2000/3000 level system an equivalent of the 100/200/300 level system?**\n",
      "A: Yes.\n",
      "\n",
      "**Q: Is it mandatory for majors to take calculus by the end of first year?**\n",
      "A: Yes. Otherwise it would be very difficult to complete your math major in 3 years. Indeed, it is extremely helpful to take calculus by the end of first year in case you intend to major in other mathematically-oriented majors such as Physics, Computer Science and Economics.\n",
      "\n",
      "**Q: Is Multivariable Calculus the same course as Calculus II?**\n",
      "A: Yes.\n",
      "\n",
      "**Q: Is ‘Probability and Statistics’ course the same course as Probability theory?**\n",
      "A: Yes, it will be treated as the same course. Students who joined in 2019 or earlier are required to take Probability theory course and students who joined in 2020(or later) need to take the Probability and Statistics course to complete a math major.\n",
      "\n",
      "**Q: Now the Probability and Statistics course is started, will the Statistical Inference course be offered?**\n",
      "A: Yes, it will be offered as an elective course and the course content for Statistical Inference is different from Probability and Statistics.\n",
      "\n",
      "**Q: Is it mandatory for majors to take multivariate calculus by the end of second year?**\n",
      "A: No, it is not mandatory. But it would be helpful while doing real analysis. But if you cannot do it in the first year, you can still do it in your 4th semester.\n",
      "\n",
      "**Q: Is it mandatory for majors to take linear algebra by the end of second year?**\n",
      "A: No, but it is strongly recommended.\n",
      "\n",
      "**Q: What is the policy on cross-listed courses?**\n",
      "A: Cross-listed courses are those courses which arise out of a discipline different from Mathematics but are cross-listed with mathematics. The students can take cross-listed courses toward their Major. The information of cross-listed courses (if there are any) will be shared with the students.\n",
      "\n",
      "**Q: I took a course in Monsoon 2019 which was cross-listed with CS. Itis being offered again in 2020 but is not showing as cross-listed. Is this a problem?**\n",
      "A: No. It is normal for courses to not be cross-listed with other departments in every semester that they’re offered. If you took a course, which was cross-listed in the semester that you took it, it will count toward your degree. Please cross-check the course code of such courses in your LMS.\n",
      "\n",
      "**Q: Can I write a thesis in the third year?**\n",
      "A: No. Only ASPs with prior approval from the department can write a capstone thesis with the department.\n",
      "\n",
      "**Q: I’m going on a semester abroad. Can I substitute the required courses with a summer abroad course?**\n",
      "A: The specific course along with its detailed syllabus will need to be shared with the Department’s HOD and a decision will be taken on a case-by-case basis.\n",
      "\n",
      "**Q: I’m interested in TA-ing for the Monsoon semester. How should I proceed?**\n",
      "A: Only 3rd year and 4th year students are eligible to TA for courses. The Department notifies the students about TA requirements in the beginning of the semester and calls for applications.\n",
      "\n",
      "**Q: Whom should I contact for further queries?**\n",
      "A: You can email the student representative Aishani Pradhan (aishani.pradhan_ug22@ashoka.edu.in) and cc the Department Manager Tejasvi Anand (tejasvi.anand@ashoka.edu.in) for any queries. For course related matters, you can also email Professor Kumarjit Saha (kumarjit.saha@ashoka.edu.in).\n",
      "\n",
      "**Q: I am confused about which elective courses to opt for. Is there someone I can talk to?**\n",
      "A: You may consult the course descriptions provided on the LMS or may reach out to your peers/seniors who have already taken courses you may be interested in. You may also seek guidance from the respective instructor.\n",
      "\n",
      "**Q: Is there an order that courses have to be taken in?**\n",
      "A: Yes. The course progression section provides a recommended order, which takes into account the prerequisites of each course.\n",
      "\n",
      "**Q: Where can I find more information related to course descriptions and syllabus?**\n",
      "A: You can consult the website https://ashoka.edu.in/mathematicsdepartment and under the tab ‘Programs’ click on ‘Math Major’. Each semester’s courses will have descriptions on LMS as well. If you have further queries, consult one of the contacts above.\n"

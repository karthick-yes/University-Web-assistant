About the Department
 
 
Philosophy
grapples
with
fundamental
questions
about
the
nature
of
reality,
knowledge,
and
how
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
we
ought
to
act.
Whether
in
the
Indian
or
Western
tradition,
answers
to
these
questions
have
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
been
supported
by
rigorous
arguments.
Our
courses
offer
a
historically
sensitive
immersion
in
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
these
arguments.
Nevertheless,
the
philosophy
major
at
Ashoka
University
aims
to
equip
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
students
to
work
beyond
the
parochialism
of
either
the
Indian
or
Western
philosophical
tradition
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
to do philosophy without boundaries.
 
 
 
The
philosophy
major
will
equip
students
with
critical
reasoning
and
analytical
problem-solving
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
skills,
expressive
precision,
and
the
intellectual
spaciousness
to
appreciate
and
engage
rationally
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
with
arguments
and
points
of
view
with
which
they
profoundly
disagree.
The
Ashoka
Philosophy
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
graduate
will
be
well
prepared
for
higher
studies
in
philosophy
or
a
career
in
e.g.
media,
law,
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
business, or consulting.

FAQs
 
 
1.
Do I need to take the philosophy courses in some specific order?
 
 
 
Prima
facie,
no.
However,
higher-division
philosophy
courses
sometimes
have
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
prerequisites
-
students
are
advised
to
check
with
the
course
instructor
for
such
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
prerequisites.
Moreover,
doing
philosophy
requires
rigorous
skill
in
reading
a
text
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
closely,
writing
critically,
logical
analysis,
and
sound
argumentation.
These
skills
are
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
often
acquired
in
lower-division
courses
and
it
is
advisable
(but
not
obligatory)
to
take
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
the
Introduction
to
Philosophy
and
the
Symbolic
Logic
courses
before
taking
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
higher-division classes in philosophy.
 
 
 
2.
Can I do a thesis before my fourth year (ASP)?
 
 
Yes, that is possible. But it will count as an Independent Study Module (ISM).
 
 
 
3.
I
am
not
a
philosophy
major.
I
want
to
complete
a
philosophy
thesis
in
my
ASP
year.
Can
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
I do so?
 
 
 
Yes,
that
is
possible
-
all
you
need
to
do
is
find
a
professor
who
is
willing
to
supervise
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
your
work.
However,
it
is
recommended
that
you
should
take
some
philosophy
courses
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
before doing a thesis.

I
am
taking
a
philosophy
course.
I
do
not
know
whether
it
is
listed
as
RC/
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
IN/HW/CC/EO. How do I find out?
 
 
 
This
is
easy
-
just
go
to
the
department
website
page
and
click
on
course
archive
section
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
(

​
).
 
 
 
5.
Is there a possibility to get a waiver for any of my degree requirements?
 
 
 
Yes,
there
is
a
possibility.
You
need
to
discuss
with
your
academic
advisor
and
the
Head
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
of the Department of Philosophy.

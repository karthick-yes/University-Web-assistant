This course asks a question that we all care about: Why are some countries more ‘developed’ than others, why are some Indian states more developed than other states? Why, for instance, is it safer for women to walk on the streets of Mumbai rather than Sonepat? And why is the average Botswanian healthier than the average resident of Somalia? The course begins by studying different definitions of “development”. It then looks at the various explanations for development, from political institutions to economic growth to cultural mores to leadership. Towards the end of the course, we will study examples of change and reform.

In this course, students will consider cognition, a subtopic within the field of psychology. The specific emphasis of cognition is on a scientific consideration of how people think and how they process information. We will examine current models in cognitive psychology from a theoretical perspective as well as the research methods that allow us to make accurate inferences about the workings of the mind. Topics will include perception, attention, memory, imagery, language, comprehension, problem solving, and decision-making.

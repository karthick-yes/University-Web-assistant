This course is an introduction to nineteenth and twentieth century political though. It is organised around two large themes. Roughly the first half of the course focuses on the question of freedom. What does it mean to be free? What is the conception of the Self that is at the centre of the nineteenth century debates over freedom? The second half focuses on distributive justice. What is Justice, and how might one think of the material distribution of goods as impinging upon freedom?

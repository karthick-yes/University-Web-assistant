That Translation as a discipline was only established quite recently is evident of the fact that for the longest time, we have viewed translation as a secondary act: as a straightforward process of transferring meaning from one language to another. However, since the formation of the discipline, a lot of work has been done by translators and academics to push the envelope as to the politics this transfer of meaning might entail. Translation is not an innocuous linguistic act, but rife with power politics. This course aims to push its students towards thinking of translation as not simple a transfer of meaning, but an embodying of difference. It will attempt to inculcate in students a method reading that grounds itself in the politics of language. Furthermore, it will allow for students to look towards and embrace non-linguistics acts of translation as well. By the end of the course, students should be able to look beyond the readings prescribed on the various facets of translation and gather an understanding of not just what translation entails, but what it leaves out.

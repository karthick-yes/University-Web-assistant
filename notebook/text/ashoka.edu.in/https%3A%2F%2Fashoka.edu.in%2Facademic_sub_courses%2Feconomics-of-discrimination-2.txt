This course familiarises students with theories and empirical tools to understand and measure economic discrimination based on social group identities, such as caste, race, gender, tribal status, ethnicity. The course will directly address caste and tribal identities, but much of the discussion applies to other identity groups as well.


We will begin with a discussion of inter-group disparities and inequalities in the Indian context. We will then move on to a discussion of some classic theories of discrimination, based on prejudice or imperfect information. Next, the course will discuss empirical methods of estimating discrimination, especially in market settings. Finally, we will look at affirmative action policies that have been used to address discrimination, especially reservations.

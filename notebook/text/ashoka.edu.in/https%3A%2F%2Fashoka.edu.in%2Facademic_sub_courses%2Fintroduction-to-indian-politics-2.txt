This course is an introduction to the study of Indian politics, with a focus on post-Independence Indian politics (i.e. from 1947 to 2019)


The course will be structured in two ways. First, we will chronologically study the various decades of post-independence politics. Second, we will study the big themes of Indian politics such as: parties, class, identity (caste, religion, region, gender), nationalism, economics, foreign policy, as well as leadership. The course is an introduction to Indian politics so no pre-requisites are necessary.

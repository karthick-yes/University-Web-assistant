The Psychology Department offers a range of courses structured around three tiers: Fundamental Courses, Core Domain Courses, and Electives. These courses give students both the breadth of the discipline and sufficient depth for students who wish to have a more narrow specialization within a domain. Note that some courses have prerequisites (courses that must be taken before enrolling in a particular course); co requisites (courses that must be taken concurrently); and preclusions (courses that have sufficiently similar emphasis and must not be taken together with that course). Most courses are worth 4 credits (unless otherwise stated), and the workload for each 4-credit course is about 10 hours per week

Ashoka Alumni










Ashoka University Alumni together form a community of diverse leaders and changemakers from all walks of life, driven to generate transformational impact on society. Alumni continue to make an impact across diverse spheres, whether as entrepreneurs, in the corporate world, development sector, research, journalists, policy, sports, academia or as professional artists. The Ashoka Alumni community is 4000+ strong and spread across 30+ countries around the world. 
 










The Ashoka Alumni Association (AAA) is the official body that connects you to 4000+ other alumni and the University. This rapidly growing network now consists of 1880+ Undergraduate alumni, 2100+ Young India Fellows, and 90+ Economics graduates across 30+ countries in the world. As a member of this robust community, you will have access to networking opportunities, mentorship programmes, professional development resources, and vibrant conversations, designed to foster connections that live well beyond graduation. The Association is represented by the Alumni Council and guided by the Alumni Board of Management.   























The Alumni Relations Office represents the University and sustains a mutually supportive relationship with  alumni, and their friends and supporters spread across the world. The ARO also facilitates deeper engagement of alumni in domains such as admissions and outreach, internships, mentorships, placements, ELMs and scholarships, thereby strengthening lifelong connections, and a culture of giving back. 
You can reach the ARO through ,  or via .












A great University is built brick by brick and requires the support of all its communities, especially you, the Alumni. As you give back to Ashoka, you contribute immensely to its stature, through higher scholarships, more research, and new facilities. Not only will you help support the next generation of students and alumni, you will also add to the value of your own diploma or degree.

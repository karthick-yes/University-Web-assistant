An Evening with Neil George, MD, Nivea and a Comic Book Author
The InfoEdge Centre for Entrepreneurship at Ashoka University hosted Neil George, the Managing Director of Nivea India, on the 3rd of November, 2022. A report by Abhirup Chatterjee (ASP'23)
Neil was invited to deliver a talk titled “Let’s Talk Money – Pricing to Win” as a part of the course ‘Strategies for Market Access’ taught by Shantanu Bhanja and Nitin Chaudhry.
Starting the session with stories about Nivea’s German roots, Neil went on to talk about the Nivea culture, the stringent global safety requirements their products follow, what a day in the life of a Nivea salesperson looks like on the shopping floor, and lastly, Nivea’s go-to-market strategy in the Indian marketplace. To make things interesting, Neil posed questions for the students and every correct answer was rewarded with either a Nivea goodie bag or a signed copy of his own comic book ‘Building the Perfect Beast: What really happens in Brand Management’. Needless to say, audience participation was abundant.
Neil did an interesting giveaway. He asked the students as to who all have used Nivea products and most of the class raised their hands. Neil went on to ask which products the students had used. However, there was one student who didn’t raise their hand. Neil gave away a Nivea goodie bag to this student stating that from now on they can’t claim to have not used Nivea. Like a true brand ambassador of Nivea, he probably created a potential Nivea customer in class.
In a talk that lasted for more than an hour in the fully packed classroom, students got a glimpse into the ideas that have made Nivea the giant it is today in the Indian marketplace despite being significantly younger than its competitors. The biggest highlight of the session, perhaps, was when a student asked Neil for the story behind the comic book he has authored – a question that might have been on everyone’s minds given how very few managing directors can boast of having published a comic book.
The idea of writing a book on brand management had come to Neil after he had left Reckitt Benckiser and was on a break before joining a private equity firm in 2010. During this hiatus from consumer products, Neil had many people visiting him for advice on brand management, with many asking the same questions. To share his knowledge with many more, he felt his calling to write and publish a book- something he thought he would have never done in his life. It was only later, after considerable market research and brainstorming, that he realized that he could use his childhood expertise in comics to make one himself – something no one had done before for marketing books. However, there was only one small problem – Neil couldn’t draw.
After an extensive search around the internet, Neil found an artist based out of Moldova who could make a comic in the ‘Dark Art’ style he wanted. And thus, began a very successful relationship – one where Neil would send the artist the storyline for a chapter and the artist would draw the scenes. It was a long and arduous process where each page took up to a week to create! Slowly but steadily, in 3 years, Neil had managed to finish 8 chapters of the book with only a few left. All seemed to be going well when suddenly, the artist, whom Neil had never met, vanished into thin air.
With no response from the artist after numerous calls and emails, Neil felt dejected. He could try finding a new artist but there was no way another artist could recreate the style of the previous chapters. For the next 3 months, Neil shelved the idea. It was during this time he remembered his bosses from the past who would often tell him that he was full of great ideas but never good at executing any of them. Neil said this is what pushed him to complete the book and how keeping it shelved would only mean that his bosses were right about him. And so the search for artists began anew. This time, he found artists much closer to home – a duo named XongBros based out of Kolkata. This time, the process was much quicker and soon, Neil was back where he had lost the Moldovan artist. For this iteration, after some feedback from friends, he decided to create a few more chapters with more fantasy-like elements. Finally, the comic book was complete and the only thing left to do was to publish it. But that came with its own challenges.
“It’s a comic book” and “This won’t sell” were the frequent responses he was met with from publishers. Not willing to give up, Neil self-published despite naysayers declaring the project doomed. During this time, he reached out to Shantanu Bhanja for his help with marketing. He connected Neil with the current Editor-in-Chief of Hindustan Times, Sukumar Ranganathan. Sukumar featured him in an article in the Mint Magazine and before long, every media house was talking about the curious case of an MD who has self-published his own comic book. With such promotion across the country, it finally caught the attention of publishers. Soon enough, Harper Collins approached him and, as Neil recounted teary-eyed, a passion project that had started 8 years ago was finally published in December 2018.
And how did Neil celebrate this milestone? He mailed all his former bosses a published copy of his comic.
Neil for sure demonstrates some of the practices to thrive mentioned in the book Leapfrog by Prof. Priyank Narayan & Prof. Mukesh Sud, like Develop Grit – the art of endurance, Nudge Yourself – tricks that work for you, and Think Entrepreneurially – the audacity of asking.

Ashoka University Researchers Examine How Social Identities & Group Norms Shape Online Conversations
This research conducted by Prof. Sramana Majumdar and her team of students is one of the first social psychological investigations into computer-mediated communication in the Indian context. The findings emphasize on how online intergender communication is shaped by social identity norms and how that is reflected in conversations around feminism
Over the last few years, we have been constantly reminded of the rapidly growing influence of social media and computer-mediated communication (CMC). While some initial research on CMC indicates that anonymity and invisibility create an equalizing effect that can eliminate stereotypes and enhance interpersonal contact, there is increasing evidence to show that it may strengthen biases because of the increased group identification and in-group salient behaviors (group salience) and reduced interpersonal cues. This is what caught Sramana Majumdar’s attention, an Assistant Professor in the Department of Psychology at Ashoka University.
Having been interested in intergroup conflict and identity, it became apparent to her that to understand present-day group identities, norms, intergroup attitudes, prejudice, and conflict, one must adequately attend to what is happening on social media. There is a lack of psychological research, especially in understudied developing countries like India, which are also some of the largest consumers of digital media. This is what motivated Prof. Majumdar and her team of research students, including Maanya Tewatia, Devika Jamkhedkar, and Khushi Bhatia at the Identity and Intergroup Relations Lab to examine this space, from a social psychological and intergroup contact perspective.
The main aim of the project was to examine social media interactions among Indian users, from a social psychological perspective. The researchers wanted to understand how social identity and group norms were shaping online conversations, and if that was transforming how and what we feel about ‘others’ (other group members, who identified with a different religion, gender, region, language, or nationality).
A mixed-method project was designed to address multiple aspects of social media interactions. Firstly, online surveys were conducted to note individuals’ self-reports and observations about their interactions across gender and religion on major social media platforms. Secondly, a qualitative discourse analysis of posts and comments on public Facebook forums that featured conversations around feminism was performed. This was to further understand how gender norms were reflected in these conversations, especially in the usage of common online terms like pseudo-feminism, INCELS, Manosphere, etc. Lastly, through multiple experiments, researchers at Ashoka University measured how the valence (negative/neutral/positive) of online posts from members of other groups, and the degree to which an individual identified with their own group, would predict attitudes towards other groups.
From the qualitative study, it was discovered that speakers conflicted over the discourse of feminism in various ways, by using traditional as well as novel terms that refer to descriptive meanings of gender categories. These included new discourses within feminism (pseudo feminism, choice feminism.) and men’s rights (Incels, MGTOW). Flaming (the use of hateful and aggressive language) was also prominent, specifically in conversations around sex and sexual choice. Here, the threat to ingroup identity was met with reactive aggression. Lastly, interactions highlighted several challenges to established meanings of feminism, by pointing towards intersectional identities.
Through comprehensive experiments, researchers at Ashoka University were able to capture how group categorization affected attitudes, where lower ingroup-outgroup* differentiation produced the most positive attitudes. Yet, this was different when we looked at historically segregated group identities (North Indian/ South Indian), where regional identity significantly influenced how the perception of positive vs negative online posts affected outgroup attitudes. Emotions like empathy also mediated the relationship between message valence and intergroup attitudes.
This is one of the first social psychological investigations into CMC in the Indian context, and one of the few studies overall to look at mediated social media interactions, that is, via asynchronous posts and comments. The findings not only add to and diversify work on CMC and intergroup relations but also highlight how existing social identities, history, and political realities interact with words and messages to change social dynamics.
It is anticipated that this research will contribute to our limited understanding of technology and social life by aiding informed policy around cyber safety that leverages positive contact and reduces the adverse consequences of negative experiences which could fuel further conflict and violence.

Ashokapreneur Highlight: Abbas Ali Zaveri, Founder, Hypefly
This interview attempts to capture the entrepreneurial journey of Abbas (UG’23) and the trajectory of Hypefly
Manoj Kumar Reddy Dinne26 December, 2022 | 4m read
What is Hypefly? How did it start and what is the story behind it?
Well, it all started back when I was in 11th Grade, just another broke teenager who wanted to buy a pair of limited-edition premium sneakers. I faced 2 major problems with this purchase, one being the fact that a pair of such sneakers was way over a student’s budget and, the other factor being that I had absolutely no idea where to find these types of sneakers in India. This drove me to speak to a lot of people, and make new connections, all in an attempt to figure out how to purchase these sneakers in India. Soon, I was able to find a community of such sneakerheads who were willing to sell me a pair. When it came to the problem of my budget to fund this purchase, I had an idea. Why not find people with similar interests, facing the same problem, and solve it by supplying these pairs which I had managed to track down? This search for buying my first pair of sneakers led to the birth of a business idea. One by one I began selling these pairs to my friends over Instagram.
The beginning was tough. I would make one sale a week, or at max. two. However, as time passed, the sale picked up. I had generated enough capital to invest in my own inventory which allowed me to create an online store as an Instagram page to put these sneakers up for sale. That was when we initially launched our Instagram page – @hypefly.in. We had a successful start since we had great organic growth and the number of sales kept growing.
Eventually one and a half years after operating from Instagram, I decided it was time to take it to another level. We formally registered as a private limited company and began the journey to create a website. From the inception of the idea and accounting for every small detail ensuring it was perfect, it took us six months until we could launch the website www.hypefly.co.in. This is the story of our journey.
From a click on the website to order to doorstep delivery, could you run us down the seamless operations you do?
Our process is smooth and convenient for the customer and us too. On the customer’s end, once they make the purchase on the website, they receive an order confirmation along with an order number. On our end, as we receive this order, it is at once located in our warehouse and sent for a quality check. This is followed by packaging and branding. We double-box and wrap all our products so our customers receive their sneakers in perfect condition. Post packaging a shipping label is generated, after which the pair is shipped and the tracking details are mailed to the customer. The whole process takes about 24 hours until dispatch after which in 36-48 hours our customers receive their kicks right at their doorstep.
What is Hypefly’s USP?
Hypefly solved the three major problems when it comes to the purchase of hyped and limited sneakers. We guarantee 100% authenticity, providing a full refund for even the smallest flaws, we solve the pricing of the collection trade off providing a large collection of 450 pairs in 10 different sizes at highly competitive prices, further we make the whole process of shopping for such sneakers seamless with our simple to use UI/UX over on our website.
Bollywood stars like Ranveer Singh, Deepika Padukone etc. are Hypefly’s customers—how did that happen?
It all started one day when I got a call from celebrity stylist Shaleena Nathani, who was making an inquiry regarding sneakers for Deepika Padukone. Stunned by her words, I quickly rounded up some options at great prices and sent them over to her. Soon after I got a call that she had made her picks and they required it delivered to the film set. That day I was able to interact with her while she tried on the shoes, and she was no doubt in love with the pairs. Later that year Shaleena requested pairs for Shah Rukh Khan and Hardik Pandya too! Over time, word spread in the industry, and stylists would contact us to style celebrities. This gave me the opportunity to interact with many celebrities, and have the biggest stars like Ranveer Singh, Siddharth Malhotra, and KL Rahul wear Hypefly.
Can you tell us about any milestones/memorable moments for you at Hypefly?
The day we launched the website will forever be one of my favourite moments. The result of six months of hard work and planning was going to be decided. The moment the website went up we saw a rapid rise in the number of live viewers resulting in issues with payments, servers, etc. We had never anticipated such a great response. Gathering the web development team, we spent the whole night troubleshooting and ensuring the performance of the website goes as per our standards. Eventually, our stress came to an end, the website took off perfectly and the orders started growing exponentially. The moment it hit me that this project was a success is one which I can never forget. The whole process from brainstorming the website, and orchestrating and marketing our launch to the excessive stress finally paid off when it went live.
What is the next big thing Hypefly is planning to do?
Over the next few years, we plan to expand into other subsidiary products ranging from sneaker care to sneaker storage. Currently, we are in the works of launching our very own clothing brand, a sustainable and affordable streetwear label. Over the next few months, we expect development with this and hopefully will launch soon. Apart from that, we have a long-term goal of launching our very own sneaker experiential store in Mumbai, which hopefully we will achieve soon!
Describe Hypefly in 3 words?
Culture, Authenticity, & Fashion
The interview was conducted by Manoj Kumar Reddy Dinne (MLS’23), who TA’ed for the Startup Incubation Lab by Srikant Sastri in Monsoon Semester 2022 where Abbas was a course participant.,https://www.ashoka.edu.in/ashokapreneur-highlight-abbas-ali-zaveri-founder-hypefly/
Ashokapreneur Highlight: Amaan Andicot, Co-Founder, Finforall
This case blog captures the story of Finforall’s journey from inception to getting acquired and everything in between
The creation of the asset
After graduating from Shiv Nadar School, Gurgaon in 12th grade, Aayush decided to take a gap year to “take a break from academia”. In that period, he caught wind of a vicious cycle wherein, kids never really got comfortable with money and thus rarely sought to figure out how to earn more of it or allocate it intelligently, apart from the standard of getting a job and putting the money that’s left over into FDs and some mutual funds that their uncle recommends. Due to poor financial habits, many people are left with a far lower amount of money than they would have if they had practised fiscal discipline. A lack of money is not the ideal situation to be in and not talking about it makes the situation worse. Aayush resolved to break this money taboo.
He did so, by starting an Instagram page which went by the name of Finforall.
With what little savings he had, Aayush hired a graphic designer part-time and focused on brand building. He ran continuous experiments on social media pertaining to the content and found that brief and concise articles interwoven with clean, yet vibrant illustrations worked very well with audiences (who at the time were friends and their extended social circles). What worked for Finforall was that carousels (a new content format on Instagram at the time) gained a significant amount of traction and were seeing farther reach than just utilising pictures and slapping articles down in the caption (which was what Finshots – the only player in the market at the time was doing). He doubled down on this new form of content by using illustrations coupled with articles that could be read in no more than 3 minutes and pushing it to the designer to have it drawn out in creatives wherein, the content took centre stage. Within the first few months of going live, Finforall had crossed the 10k follower base mark. This follower count is important as per data from social blade spanning hundreds of pages, the founders realised that the algorithm Instagram uses to push out content to new audiences goes into overdrive once a page crosses 10,000 followers.
Getting to the 10k mark is arguably one of the hardest milestones to achieve on an Instagram page as growth primarily must either be: 1) inorganic (leveraging Instagram ads) which puts engagement at risk, or 2) via word of mouth which is extremely difficult to achieve.
Aayush found that Finforall was in a unique position. Given the surge of interest that took place during the pandemic for investing and the increased amount of screentime people put in towards social media, there was latent demand just waiting to be tapped and no player in the market was capitalizing on it. This first-mover advantage enabled Finforall to scale aggressively and that too, organically (i.e – with 0 ad spends). At the time, Finshots had total dominance on the newsletter segment; however, Instagram was a relatively underutilized platform on the topic of Finance. Thus, less competition and strong demand from consumers made Aayush plough on with Finforall, eventually rolling out podcasts that were available on Spotify, Apple Music and all major platforms. These podcasts hosted industry legends like Matt Dajer from Yes Theory (a prominent YouTube page), Tanmay Bhat from AIB & Nikhil Kamath, Co-Founder of Zerodha.
Eventually, Finforall scaled to 50,000 followers and Aayush had burned over Rs. 2,00,000 into the project without any sight of obtaining a return on the capital invested.
Entry of a co-founder
Finforall as a company started with a very specific chance interaction. While out on a family vacation to Rishikesh, Amaan happened to get acquainted with an HNI. Upon learning about Amaan’s interest in investing and his track record over the years, the strategies and rationale behind the investments made, the HNI offered to sign Amaan a cheque to kickstart a public market investment fund with a long-term investment horizon, if Amaan could provide a rationale behind the usage of the money. The catch: in the future or at any point in his career, if Amaan was to turn entrepreneurial and start a venture, the HNI would be issued equity as a sign of good faith. Secondly, in case of any capital losses, Amaan would be personally liable for paying him back his principal amount. The flip side to this was, that if Amaan were to consistently outperform the markets for a 5-year horizon, the HNI would up his stake in the fund and get other HNIs to invest with him. This was a deal of a lifetime for Amaan as it gave him exactly what he dreamt about…his own investment fund. This deal however came at a steep cost.
Pressed with this decision, Amaan reached out to Aayush, an old friend and a devil’s advocate. After hearing about the terms of the deal, Aayush simply advised “don’t do it, dude”. Instead, he came up with another proposal. He threw Amaan an offer to own half of Finforall as a Founder and to create a business model around it. Aayush was creative with his solutions to problems, while Amaan was an executor who’d bring ideas to life.
Equity Split
Aayush and Amaan didn’t want to needlessly inflate the value of the business especially when there is no revenue or profit to justify such a steep increase. While Amaan was adamant about getting in at the lowest possible valuation as Finforall was just one year old at that time, Aayush felt strongly that he had taken on a disproportionate amount of risk doing it alone full-time for an entire year, investing his savings and taking a gap year with no clear ROI. Finally, it was decided that Amaan would buy a 50% stake off of Aayush. This enabled the valuation to stay low enabling Amaan to get in on the ground floor, i.e – keeping the business valued at Rs. 4 lakhs while compensating Aayush for his risk-taking. Thus, they agreed on a 50-50 equity split.
Both founders had seen many businesses fail due to irreconcilable differences among the founders, which eventually permeated into other issues. So, both of them would regularly talk through why a certain course of action was better and if the other wasn’t convinced, they would drop the idea altogether. Such a style worked given a high degree of alignment among their values. They were striving to create a cash-compounding machine and one that was not only sustainable but profitable, to begin with.
Structuring out the Company: The Birth of a Business Model
The founders found out that they had a concentrated niche of:
- 24-35-year-olds
- A healthy mix of both genders
- People have either just started working or have limited work experience
- Educated audience with basic knowledge about personal finance
- Possession of savings that can be invested and used 1-2 Bank Accounts
The founders realised that the readers were their greatest asset. To be the customer acquisition channel for finance-based startups, Finforall started offering digital marketing services. It did so by running integrated posts for reputed fintech Brands and financial services companies. So:
- Finforall positioned itself at a premium price point given the high quality of audiences.
- The first ad campaign run was for CoinDCX.
Following a stringent KYC process Finforall only promoted brands which fit at least one of the two categories:
- Founders had used the product/service themselves and felt satisfied.
- The product/service would be of value to their readers.
This helped Finforall, retain the trust of their audiences. Simply put, they put their ear to the ground, studied vast amounts of data and tried to diagnose what problems the audiences faced and how those problems could be solved.
This eventually led to the need to expand the team. Finforall was operating at a very small scale and the founders had to get creative with the hiring process. Knowing that beaten-down stocks tend to trade for lower than even their cash value on the books, they adopted a similar strategy for hiring:
- Find meritorious prospects that have the academic calibre and domain experts but lack soft skills.
- These prospects got passed on for numerous prestigious internships or jobs.
- This in turn enabled Finforall to have high bargaining power with their hires and the hires accepted below industry standards for pay.
This allowed Finforall to expand aggressively while keeping its costs in check. Barring a token salary, all profits that were borne after paying off the entire team’s salaries were ploughed right back into the business, leading to huge profits.
Finforall leveraged the user feedback – there was a high demand for people to learn investing. There was a lack of solid offerings in the market. So Finforall went ahead and handcrafted a course for a batch size of 30 seats (later raised to 50). Rationale – quality came first above all else and only serious candidates were granted seats. The USP of the course was simple – the course provided meritorious members with a shot at working with a highly prestigious hedge fund based in India. Finforall was happy to discover the product market fit – receiving 250 applicants within the first 48 hours of opening up the course to their focus groups. The course was priced at Rs. 3,499 a seat. Courses having a zero marginal cost of replication allowed them to remain asset-light.
An Opportunity to Raise Investment
Due to the traction, Finforall enjoyed a YCombinator-backed startup that wanted to explore the possibility of investing in the company. The founders flew down to Mumbai, however, after preliminary discussions Aayush and Amaan decided against raising investment given that they didn’t need the capital at that stage and so this would be needlessly diluting the equity. The idea was to remain bootstrapped for as long as possible.
Competitive Pressures
Inspired by the traction received by Finforall, new players started entering the market. Due to increased competition, organic growth for Finforall began to stall.
This is when the founders turned to utilising data and tried to assess what kind of content could go viral. The strategy coupled with targeted inorganic expansion got the growth engine back into full gear.
During this period, barely anybody was advertising on social media. Ad spends were as low as Rs 0.5-0.75 per account. For context, when the advertising boom followed a few months later, ad spending jumped to figures as high as Rs. 2-5 per account reached. Inorganic forms of growth helped Finforall reach the 75k follower mark. This led to significant attention from multiple brands and deal flow began to resume.
In this time period, many foreign clients were opening up shops in India and Finforall became their favourite to advertise with given its audience composition.
Inflow from foreign clients = Need of reaching audiences with high net worths = Competition for limited ad space on Finforall = Pricing Power, given brand value.
Navigating the Acquisition
In December 2021, a foreign hedge fund managed to obtain an overseas direct investment licence from the RBI. This fund was making waves at that time featuring in Sucheta Dalal’s Moneylife, ET, and Financial Express (to name a few). This hedge fund was keen on running an integrated ad campaign on Finforall. The hedge fund turned out to be the dream client for Finforall. Firstly, it paid the full amount upfront which is rare when it comes to running campaigns. Secondly, a single integrated post that Finforall ran for them generated $23,000 worth of investments for the fund. Thus, they were keen on exploring the possibility of acquiring Finforall.
The hedge fund was happy to close the deal on the terms that the founders put forth and executed the transaction quickly. Amaan and Aayush knew the euphoria in the market wasn’t going to last forever and if they were to take their chips off the table, then that was the time. Their mentor of sorts offered to float the acquisition offer around to see if he could get them a better deal than what was on the table. The founders also consulted an industry veteran regarding the market behaviour and that confirmed their hypothesis.
The very next day, their contact returned with two buyers. One Jupiter – a neo-bank and the second NeoPay – an Indian e-commerce system and payments processor for teens. Finforall had 3 potential buyers at the table which gave the founders the ability to negotiate the best possible deal by staking one offer against the other.
Eventually, the hedge fund applied pressure on insisting on closing the deal within the following week. This forced the founders to negotiate more aggressively with the other potential buyers. In the end, they narrowed it down to 2 potential avenues:
Jupiter – same target groups, highly experienced management, ideal culture fit for Finforall. The valuation was at 21x Revenue which was better than the hedge fund deal. Additional Clauses: 3-year non-compete post-1-year binding employment contract to oversee the transition.
Hedge Fund – Faster closure of the deal, more tax efficient (transaction in cash), news articles on both founders regarding the acquisition, no binding clauses or non-compete.
The Jupiter deal was of larger ticket size, and was a better fit for Finforall but came with sharp consequences. The Hedge fund deal on the other hand gave the founders the freedom to do what they wanted as soon as the transaction was closed. This was ideal given the fact that they were attempting to perform a hostile majority stake takeover on a similarly sized competitor of Finforall due to fundamental differences between their stakeholders. What worked against the Hedge Fund deal was the pressure to decide quickly.
In addition to this, Amaan and Aayush had never been able to get onto a video call with the hedge fund buyers. On the other hand, Jupiter’s management was more than communicative. During the entire acquisition saga, the founders noticed that the Hedge Fund’s Chief Investment Officer was slated to come onto a prestigious conclave/summit that happens once a year and is run by an extremely reputed media house. Looking at the image of the CIO, they ran a backwards search only to find out that that’s not him, but rather a stock image of a “businessman” that’s been used in 14 different places including MensHealth!
The term sheet for both deals came in on the same day. They went ahead with Jupiter.
At the time of pitching, Finforall had a follower base of 132K, reached 1,032,118 accounts and garnered over 6,128,000 impressions over a 90-day period. The page had a baseline engagement rate of 3.48%.
Keywords:
- Traction = Follower Growth
- Engagement Rate = For social media pages, it is calculated as:
(Likes+Comments+Saves+Shares) / Total Follower Base
The higher the engagement rate of a page, the better the page is from a quality standpoint.
- Carousels = a slideshow format of putting together photos in the same Instagram post

Between Classes & Office Hours: A Candid Conversation with Prof. Mukesh Sud
On a cold winter morning as Prof. Sud takes a break to enjoy his fruits, we got a brief opportunity to have a candid conversation with him to get to know him better
Mukesh Sud is an Associate Professor at the Indian Institute of Management, Ahmedabad, and a Visiting Faculty at the Department of Entrepreneurship, Ashoka University.
We recently got a chance to have a chat with him about the various aspects of his life.
Here is what he had to say:
How did you begin teaching at Ashoka University?
It was really happenstance. I joined IIM Ahmedabad in 2015 after returning from the US. I would often come and spend weekends on campus with my daughter who was in the founding batch. On one such visit, I was invited to speak to the students about entrepreneurship. One thing led to another, I met the founders who saw a synergy between my experience at liberal arts universities in the US and the program here. I have now been offering at least one course every term for the past 6 years.
How different are students here from those you have at Ahmedabad?
Oh, very different. MBA students at IIMA are typically focused on a job. Many of them have student loans that they need to pay back and a job is the only way they can do that. Many will consider entrepreneurship maybe 5-10 years later. Others may become intrapreneurs that are entrepreneurs within the companies they work for. Alums tell us that having an entrepreneurial mindset is one of the necessary skills that we must teach our MBA students.
Are students here like the ones you taught in the US?
Yes, in some ways and different in others. Both here and in the US, liberal arts students enjoy trying out a number of courses before deciding what they would like to major in. At Ashoka, students are very concerned about their careers, and the jobs they will get after graduation. Students in the US, unless they have a loan, go with the flow and treat college as a time to enjoy themselves and be away from their parents. We used to joke that at Fairfield U, where I previously taught, the faculty, the administrators, and the Jesuit priests would all claim that students were drawn to the university due to what they offered. When students were polled about why they had joined the answer was a reality check for us all. It was Fairfield’s reputation as a party town and the nearby beach that was the main draw in attracting students.
Which do you enjoy more- teaching here at Ashoka or at IIMA?
Both give different types of satisfaction. At the Institute students are drawn to my elective after they have got jobs. They want to pick up skills like design thinking that will be needed in the corporate world. Here at Ashoka, students would like to cultivate an entrepreneurial mindset which they feel will help them in whatever they do whether in a job or in launching their own ventures.
What changes have you noticed in the students over the past 7 years?
A lot! The students are more focused and more competitive. I pull my daughter’s leg that she was fortunate to be in the founding batch. With the increased competitiveness she may not have been able to get admission today. She of course is quick to reply that the initial few batches laid the foundation to make Ashoka what it is today.
What is your area of research?
Broadly an entrepreneurial mindset. Lately, however, I have changed the kind of research I do. Rather than writing papers that get published in scholarly journals, I have written a book. Our research papers are only read by academics. There is so much hidden away in them that can help our students as they navigate their careers. Along with Priyank Narayan from the Centre, we have just published a book which describes six practices that will enable people to leapfrog to the future they want. The book, also called Leapfrog, has been published by Penguin.,https://www.ashoka.edu.in/between-classes-office-hours-a-candid-conversation-with-prof-mukesh-sud/
Between Classes & Office Hours: Experience of Teaching as a Visiting Faculty at Ashoka University
Sridhar is an investor and a prolific traveler. In this blog he describes his journey and his experience as a Visiting Faculty at Ashoka
Sridhar Sethuram26 December, 2022 | 6m read
I, for the past 3 decades, post-IIM Ahmedabad, have been engaged in co-creating businesses with entrepreneurs as an Operational Private Equity Investor and a Listed Stock Market investor with a PE Mindset. I have also been divinely blessed to have backpacked 120+ countries across the 7 continents and 25 of the 29 Indian states. I have also been an avid trekker and marathoner. I am also a part-time visiting Faculty at various B-Schools.
Since 2015, I have been teaching at various B-Schools, various versions of the course named Demystifying Investments – PE/VC (Private Equity/Venture Capital). The investment thesis is to inspire at least 5-10 % of the class to think differently and inject them with the “keeda” of being a maverick and hope that they would go out and positively impact society and send blessings to me when they succeed. It is a form of giving back to society in gratitude for all the privileges one has received in this lifetime. It was a blessing in disguise when Priyank Narayan at Ashoka University agreed to offer me a platform to pilot experimenting with the course at an undergrad level.
The course is based on the fundamental premise that the personal life and career of every individual is also one of an investor and entrepreneur. Students can apply the same investment principles when making decisions in professional life – including when they decide their career choices (where to invest the time capital of life) and entrepreneurship (everyone has to have an entrepreneurial mindset whether on salary or not). And their journey from being a start-up professional to one with experience and wisdom is similar to that of any business enterprise.
The course takes the participants on a journey through the lens, mindset and decision frameworks of an investor across:
- Life Stages: Across Angel, Seed, VC, PE, Pre-IPO and Listed markets with a PE mindset
- Asset Classes: Unlisted, Real Estate and Listed Stocks
- Sectors: Real Estate, FinTech, Social enterprises and Ecommerce
The course includes India-specific case studies and sharing of experiences of successful investors and entrepreneurs.
The course has the following vectors to achieve learning outcomes:
- Cases and pre-class group submissions
- In-class Case Discussion
- Fireside chat with guest speakers preferably linked to the case
- RolePlay of an Investment Committee where Students present the investment thesis for sectors/ companies they have chosen
The key highlights of my teaching experience here at Ashoka are as follows:
- I was amazed that the participants could hold attention for 3+ hours. This proves my hypothesis that this generation does NOT display Attention Deficit Syndrome when there is value on the table delivered with fun and transparency. My last class ( an extra one and that too at student request on a Sunday) lasted 4 hours 15 mins with students joining me at lunch for another hour.
- The course includes fireside chats, which are designed to be conducted by a selected panel of 2-3 students with no involvement of the instructor. I was super impressed with the quality of the questions in the class and the conduct of the session. Almost every speaker had a googly question asked which made them pause and think.
- The interactions with the students outside class have been enrichening. I was impressed with the hunger to learn and make a difference in Life in most of the course participants.
- Last but not the least, as the course progressed, there was a marked improvement in the intellectual rigour and application of the pre-class case submissions. Some of the final submissions were much better than those from B School students or even better than what I would have delivered as an MBA student😊.
Teaching at Ashoka has been a multi-bagger investment (esp. considering I travel 12 hours to and fro Mumbai to teach a class of 240 mins and would be returning to take more courses across the coming semesters. You learn so much from the class and have such fun in the class discussions.
Hats off to the founders and leadership at Ashoka to have built such a great institution in such a short time. I would highly recommend becoming visiting faculty at Ashoka to other professionals. The adrenaline rush from being granted the opportunity to sculpt such young curated minds and souls, and make a difference in their life is priceless.
Best wishes to the Ashoka team. I am sure the students will have a phenomenal impact on the future trajectory of not only India but the world.

Between Classes & Office Hours: Web3 & the Creator Economy
Jaspreet Bindra is a thought-leader on digital transformation and digital technologies. During one of his trips from Cambridge to Ashoka, he penned down his insights on the Creator Economy in the Web3
Jaspreet Bindra19 December, 2022 | 6m read
As you browsed the World Wide Web, you would have certainly encountered the infamous 404 error, signifying that a web page is ‘not found’. What you have not seen is a similar code 402, which actually stands for ‘payment required’. This was the piece that Tim Berners-Lee and his team left unfinished when they were fashioning the World Wide Web many decades back. The original intention was that every visitor had to pay something to view a web page, but the schema was never built, and even now, therefore, there is no standardised encoded way to send or receive money online.
The fact that user-pays was never the business model of the Web. Initially, most of it was free. Then, Yahoo and others scaled up publishing and advertising as the business model, which Google and Facebook took to another level. Besides advertiser-pays, another business model started taking shape – that of commerce, which Amazon started dominating. Off late, the tech world has begun revisiting the payments and commerce business model again. The reason is very simple – all of the advertising is $470bn a year, and e-commerce is ten times bigger at $5tn a year, albeit with thinner margins. E-commerce makes up approximately 18 per cent of the overall retail market already and is growing fast. Companies like Square, Paypal and UPI in India are building the online payments infrastructure to address the original 402 error. But the company dominating it and making it as simple as Berners-Lee and his team perhaps envisaged is the San Francisco-head-quartered Stripe. Stripe burst into prominence with its one-time valuation of $95bn, making it the most valuable private company ever. With its ambitious mission statement to ‘increase the GDP of the Internet’, it heralds a far more dramatic shift: the business model of the World Wide Web is shifting – from advertising to payments and subscriptions. The signs have been there for a while. The tech lash against rampant data monetization and the impact on privacy is the most prominent. Facebook has added shopping tabs on Instagram, it has started payments on WhatsApp in India and Brazil, and it has even debuted its own cryptocurrency. Tiktok is treading into e-commerce with a partnership with Shopify, and now, Elon Musk is making Twitter a subscription model too with the $8 Twitter Blue!
This new decentralised monetization model is giving rise to what is called Web3. A lot has been written about Web3, and it has become an elastic term being used for anything: pure crypto plays used it to make them sound more respectable, minting NFTs of bored mammals are seen to be Web3 ideas, so is buying virtual land or doing fashion shows in the ‘metaverse’. Yes, Web3 is all of this, but it is much more. Web 1.0 was about reading static content pages on MSN, Yahoo or AOL, and started in the 1990s. Web 2.0 burst forth in 2005 with Facebook, Twitter, YouTube and the like and is about people creating and posting their own content, going beyond just passively reading it. Web3 (for some reason using 3.0 is considered unfashionable) goes beyond where you not only actively participate, but also own and build pieces of it through ownership tokens and blockchain technologies, thus distributing ownership away from the highly centralised ownership of Web 2.0. So, if Web 1.0 was about Read, Web 2.0 is Read and Write, Web3 would be about Read, Write and Own.
But nothing signifies this titanic shift to Web3 and the new monetization model as the rapid rise of what is being called the ‘creator or passion economy’. This concept of enabling people with an online following to make money from sales was initially popularised in China. Then came Twitch which did this in gaming, Patreon which enabled crowdfunding for artists, and then Substack which helps writers monetize their blogs and columns. The original creator economy pioneer was perhaps YouTube, with kids in the US three times more likely to want to become YouTubers than astronauts!
The term was introduced in a seminal blog post ‘The Passion Economy and the Future of Work’ by Li Jin of Andreesen Horowitz, where she talked about how this trend will shift the current mass standardisation to ‘monetizing individuality’, where we “view individuality as a feature, not a bug.” The VC firm SignalFire says that this new ‘economy’ has more than 50mn creators, of which two million are making more than $100000 a year! Most of them are writers, artists, singers, and people with a passion in the arts, rather than the techies you would expect. The pandemic turbo-charged this economy – Etsy, an original creator economy company where individuals sell artisanal objects, had $346mn of mask sales! It was in 2006, that Chris Anderson predicted this trend in his book The Long Tail. His thesis was that products in low demand can collectively make up the market share of blockbuster rivals. He prophesied, “When the tools of production are available to everyone, everyone becomes a producer.” 15 years later, his wish that we move away from “suffering the tyranny of lowest-common-denominator fare” is coming to fruition.
Small live streams on Twitch outcompete with the Oscars and Grammys. OnlyFans users pay for niche and private conversations and viewings of individuals, rather than watch blockbusters. YouTube has 30mn channels, with those earning more than $10000 growing at 40%. The top 10 authors on Substack collectively make over $15M per year. The top content creator on Podia, a platform for video courses, makes more than $100,000 a month. Even the mighty Amazon, a standardised marketplace, is wary of the individual-driven Shopify. NFTs or Non-Fungible Tokens, an integral part of the Web3 economy have emerged to help digital artists monetize their offerings is one more offshoot of the creator economy. Then there is the Metaverse. While it is still early days and Meta and others are under pressure to build it into a monetizable model, it offers an unprecedented opportunity for creators to monetize their offerings. This Economy is rising in India too, with startups like GoSocial creating platforms and tools to help artists monetize their wares. The Long Tail is getting longer and more rewarding. “In the future, everyone will be world-famous for 15 minutes”, said Andy Warhol in a 1968 exhibition of his work at the Moderna Museet in Stockholm. What he did not foretell was that everyone’s fame would be experienced concurrently and monetized so well.

Between Classes & Office Hours: Business Communication and Negotiation: Constructing, Deconstructing and Reconstructing Paradigms of Success
Prof. Asha Kaul is a veteran professor and a prolific author in the Communications area. While she already teaches Business Communication and Negotiation here at Ashoka, she wishes to demystify the subject for the wider ecosystem through this piece
Asha Kaul19 December, 2022 | 6m read
Communication- formal and organizational – can be tough. You may have experienced it. In case not, let us imagine…The stage is set and you need to interact, engage and communicate for that elusive win. What do you do? How do you prepare? Do the following questions prop up in your mind – Where do I begin? What do I say? Will I be able to create the desired impact? Sometimes you have an answer to these questions and communication is a huge success but on other occasions, the outcome is not favourable.
Where did you go wrong? What did you say what should not have been said? What did you not say what was expected to have been said? You may reflect and analyse, try to change your communication and adopt an amicable stand if you have the time. But the moment has passed and there is a negative tick placed beside your name.
In the course on Business Communication and Negotiation, we understand varied situations, and look for tactics and strategies to counter negativity and imbue positivity. Through the sessions, we constantly construct, deconstruct and reconstruct communication in an attempt of redefining success paradigms.
Construction
This requires effort. Understanding the situation and the involved stakeholders(the audience), the interplay between the situation and the stakeholders, and the relationship shared by all concerned stakeholders is just the beginning point for constructing the dialogue. Comprehending existing processes of communication with a peep into our own barriers to communication is just the beginning point. Cognizing our strengths, and chasing and curating the areas of improvement provides each one of us a base to create our own edifice for communication. For some it is a strengthening of the existing processes, for others, it is an understanding of the outside world, the expectations and their own contributions in reaching the ‘win’ situation.
Clips featuring corporate leaders add to the fury of the discussion. Can ideas and emotions be reflected through verbal and non-verbal communication? If yes, what are the signs and signals to be cognized? How do all these signs and signals converge to yield single or multiple messages? The process more than the outcome becomes the central point of discussion.
By now, understanding the process of construction is over… what now?
Deconstruction
Take a long pause and a deep breath … have you considered the logic of the recipient? What appeals and what does not? Is the framing right, and the tone appropriate? How do you logically plug the audience requirements in the edifice you have created? Logic then becomes the pivot for analysis of such problem situations. In both, oral as well as written communication, content is broken up into smaller chunks for in-depth analysis and evaluation.
Now begins the more tedious part of understanding the audience, their expectations and subsequent recalibration. Listening with an objective to understanding the perspective of the audience, presenting with a focus on the stakeholders, negotiating to cooperate more than compete, building narratives to appeal to the sensibilities, persuading and influencing to change behaviour for compliance, facilitates the deconstruction of existing communication processes and procedures.
The scattered bits and pieces of the deconstructed processes now require to be assembled. Should the process be phased or simultaneous? What will emerge as the new picture?
Reconstruction
Simultaneous with deconstruction begins the process of reconstruction. All introspect and gather a list of unwanted pieces of baggage in the knapsack we have been carrying over the years. Some more introspection is required at this point. What should you throw out and what should you retain? It is a personal choice based on the nature of the desired reconstruction. Panel discussions with experts in the area of communication and entrepreneurship act as a beacon of light. Understanding the challenges faced by these experts, their failures and the success matrix facilitates in the creation of a career compass which guides us in the right direction.
An important part of the reconstruction phase is the creation of a signature voice, an understanding of the je ne sais quoi (don’t know what). Initially, it may be difficult for us to identify the unique selling proposition (USP) that each one of us possesses. Some introspection, some reflection and we begin inching closer to the identification of ourselves, discovering our signature voice. Communication, appearance and body language have all been discussed, but the gravitas is now discovered and matched with the leadership style that each one of us possesses but has so far not verbalized.
Though the course comes to a logical end, the process for the students does not! It is just the beginning of a long and arduous journey. Traversing the path with ease or difficulty is a must. Interestingly, the destination at the end of this journey is the same for all – success. All that is now needed is a proactive step and a long stretch to clasp that definitive handle-defined success.

Biosciences in the Century of Complexity
Prof. Anurag Agrawal, Dean, Biosciences and Health Research, Trivedi School of Biosciences, illuminates upon his vision for the School
Anurag Agrawal31 August, 2023 | 4m read
At the turn of the century, Stephen Hawking said, “I think the next century will be the century of complexity”. Indeed, the elegant simplicity of the 20th century, with Einsteinian physics or uncovering the double helix code of life, has yielded way to a messier science where we focus on finding order within highly complex, interconnected systems. One of the major transformations has been in Biology. From sensing changes in geo-planetary ecosystems to capturing health trajectories of individuals and societies, there is a new interdisciplinary push that makes it likely that this will be the century of biology. The Trivedi School of Biosciences (TSB) recognises this need to seamlessly bring biosciences, advanced computing, other natural sciences, social sciences, and innovation together into one ecosystem of advancement.
TSB contains the Department of Biology and associated centres for enabling education and research in biosciences. Threads of data science and interdisciplinarity are woven into the fabric of TSB by design. While still a young department, the faculty has diverse expertise and backgrounds ranging from ecology to medicine. A state-of-the-art new building to house TSB with world-class ambience and facilities is nearing completion. Critical partnerships are in place. The need of the hour is to define and nucleate complementary centres, which may one day grow into institutions and multi-investigator labs that may develop into centres. Towards this, the Centre for Health Analytics Research and Trends (CHART) and the Koita Centre for Digital Health at Ashoka (KCDH-A) have already taken shape between TSB and the Department of Computer Science.
Recognising the importance of diverse data types spanning people, animals, and environment in the conceptualisation of One Health, CHART aims to collect, curate, integrate, analyse, and disseminate such data while also recognising that solutions to most large-scale problems, such as a pandemic, require an understanding of the surrounding socio-economic-political frameworks. Thus, it is a privilege that CHART has come to exist alongside ongoing Ashokan initiatives like the Center for Economic Data (CEDA) and the Centre for Social and Behaviour Change (CSBC).
Simultaneously, the convergence of healthcare, genomics, information technology, and artificial intelligence revolutions have also radically changed how health will be imagined and delivered for individuals and communities. KCDH-A aspires to develop fresh perspectives and nurture a new generation of Digital Health thinkers, innovators, and implementers through a balanced emphasis on education and research.
CHART and KCDH-A are just the beginning. Deeper insights into cancer biology and human genetics along with advanced studies of glycans and metabolic programming, would help form other nucleation points. While these are envisioned as team research topics, individual-driven deep thinking and research remain critical. Despite increasing focus on translational research by funding agencies, the fact remains that one must understand before one can translate.
The larger vision of TSB is to enable researchers to ask significant questions that cut horizontally across the verticals represented by the centres. For example, it is likely that complex sugars in foods, when metabolised by gut bacteria, lead to the release of metabolites and glycan products that alter immune programming. It is also well known that poor nutrition or infections can reprogram immunity, leading to altered health risks, including cancer. So far, we have a minimal understanding of these topics, whether at the fundamental level of mechanisms or the higher level of applications. More importantly, these intersections extend well beyond classic experimental biology. Computational structural simulations, synthetic biology, and systems immunology are all junctional fields of great promise. With a finite number of faculty, TSB is not expected to solve the unsolved suddenly. Instead, it is expected to champion a different and unfettered way of working across disciplines to collaboratively advance the field, serving as a model for change. That is the Ashokan vision.

#Bookmarked: Leapfrogging your way to success
‘Leapfrog: Six Practices to Thrive at Work’ by Mukesh Sud and Priyank Narayan, published by Penguin India, lays down six evidence-based insights to help readers advance their careers at an incredible pace
Saman Waheed28 November, 2022 | 4m read
Priyank Narayan is the Head of the Department of Entrepreneurship and the Director of the InfoEdge Centre for Entrepreneurship at Ashoka University. Mukesh Sud is an Associate Professor at the Indian Institute of Management, Ahmedabad, and a Visiting Faculty at the Department of Entrepreneurship, Ashoka University.
Their book, “Leapfrog” blends stories and anecdotes which are supported by extensive research to suggest six ways to flourish at work. Utilising their extensive experience of teaching and mentoring students the authors have developed a Personal Journey Map (PJM). This will help readers implement the six practices by capturing their current repertoire, scanning the landscape ahead, and curating a path to a career they desire.
We spoke to the authors about their experiences that led to the creation of this book. Here is what they had to say.
What were some of the incidents/people who helped lay the foundation of this book?
The ideas in this book are from our students. We have dedicated the book to them. We learn from them every day. Our students have shared their experiences on what works and has not worked for them at their workplace. We also had alumni, recruiters, and parents who shared their observations. The book is an amalgamation of everything we have experienced inside and outside the classroom since we started teaching.
In addition to that, we have extensively studied these practices to find out what researchers have discovered about them. Each story, practice, and pillar in the book has been validated. It may start with an anecdote but is supported by literature—we have around 30 pages of citations.
What were some of your key learnings while you were working on this book?
We kept iterating on the practices and the process to ensure that students not only succeed but can thrive in the workplace. We realized that the key to writing a book is to keep the reader engaged by giving them something that is doable and showing them how others have used it. We were able to learn this in the process of writing this book.
One of the practices we discuss in this book is curation. We had to live this practice by curating what we put together in this book. It has also helped us in our teaching as we now have a lot more focus on what we want our students to imbibe and develop.
We pushed each other so that we could validate a number of our intuitions with published research. We had to read extensively, speak to a lot of people and then build that into our book. It has been a strenuous but rewarding journey over three years.
Was this book initially conceptualized as a collaboration between the both of you?
Mukesh has been teaching at Ashoka University for the last seven years. We have been good friends for a long time. The acknowledgement section in the book has the story of how we met and got involved as a part of a collaboration between two premier institutions, IIM Ahmedabad and Ashoka University.
This book is an outcome of what good institutions with individuals who have the right intentions can create when they come together. As co-authors, we had to agree conceptually on the values we wanted to write about. So, the collaboration between us grew over time and we were then able to intellectually challenge each other.
I think we complemented each other very well. Mukesh had a strong MBA and research focus. I came from an undergraduate liberal arts teaching environment. where I had a lot of very practical anecdotes of students that I had taught. So, we were able to bring our forces together to create a good balance of theory and practice.
This model of collaboration is something that other educational institutions should look at. We often look at research and writing as being very inward-focused. If other institutions can be inspired to find partners to create and document knowledge, great collaborations can take place.
Who, in your opinion, should read this book?
The book is meant for everybody who cares about doing well at work—in their career and their life. Examples in the book are simple and apply to everybody. Whether the readers want to be efficient in managing their home, office, or life, they will find some story in the book that will resonate with them.
A lot of parents have reached out to us saying that they love some of the stories and are reading them to their children. There is enough for everybody to read and imbibe.
The book does not have to be read in one go. It has been divided into sections and each one offers a unique lesson in itself. It is ultimately what one wants to make out of it.
The interesting part of the book is that it also provides the readers with a Personal Journey Map (PJM), a framework that helps the readers plan and put into practice whatever they have learned from the book.
Leapfrog is not just a book to read, it is also a thinking and doing book. People should imbibe these practices and their pillars as a habit while they move forward.
What is the one piece of advice you would like to give to the readers if they want to thrive at work or in their life?
One very important element of doing well at work is having a well-defined goal. Many of us are hungry for success without knowing what success means for us. The goal might change and evolve over time but we need to pursue it. Only then can we find a path to get there.
We always encourage our students to think about what would make them happy. That in itself is a difficult question to answer, not just for students, but even for mid-career and senior professionals. However, people need to push themselves, otherwise, it becomes a classic story of ‘I am happy to be on a path without knowing the direction in which it is going.’
The first chapter in the book is about developing grit. Grit in one line is defined as passion and perseverance which can sustain over time. We can do anything we want in life if we can demonstrate grit because ultimately there is no shortcut to hard work.
Is there anything else apart from this, that you would like the readers to know before they jump into this book?
The world today expects everybody to do well, and that too at a young age. That early success is glamorized. This is one of the myths we want to challenge through this book, where we say that one can do well at any age. We talk about people who take time to get successful, and that is perfectly fine. Some people have to deal with a lot of constraints before they become successful, and that is fine as well.
We also have a website for the book for readers who want to engage with and explore the ideas beyond the book.
We would love to hear from readers about what they think and how they have been able to apply the learnings in their life.

Breaking the Mold: How Liberal Arts Can Open Up Infinite Avenues
As Stuti Ravikumar joins Unilever’s Future Leaders Programme, she reminisces about her time at the Young India Fellowship and recounts its profound impact on her life
Stuti Ravikumar’s journey epitomizes the spirit of multidisciplinarity and how a holistic, liberal arts education can open up infinite new ways of thinking and innumerable opportunities. Originating from Mysore, Stuti had spent most of her life there pursuing her education. An academically bright student in school, she was a jack of all trades as she signed up for several extracurricular activities. Stuti was always somewhat dissatisfied with the education system because it did not give her the freedom to study multiple subjects and disciplines. As she went on to pursue biotechnological engineering in Mysore, the minimal freedom she got when it came to choosing her electives was even more upsetting. Post-graduation, Stuti went on to intern at the reputed Merck Life Labs in Bangalore and started to build a niche for herself in the immunobiological space.
Alongside pursuing her engineering degree, Stuti freelanced for a newspaper in Mysore and worked for an NGO. During her time in college, she found herself fascinated by the world of fitness and nutrition and ventured deeper into that domain as well. Despite making strides in her professional and personal life, Stuti’s hunger for knowledge and multidisciplinary learning remained unsatiated. “I found out about the Young India Fellowship on a friend’s Instagram. I spent hours scrolling through their social media page and website because I found myself completely enthralled by the programme. Coming from a relatively small town, I did not know that something like a liberal arts education existed. It was as if the fellowship with its vast number of subjects and its diverse cohort was tailor-made for me,” said Stuti.
“While I did enjoy studying biotechnology and engineering, quant-heavy subjects were not really my strength. I was interested but I was not particularly inspired. That changed momentously when I came to Ashoka University for the Fellowship. The classes were designed in a way that sparked curiosity,” Stuti explained. When asked about what course was her favourite, she told us that it was undoubtedly Professor Debayan’s The New Geography of the Information Age. The course focused on the socio-technical problems caused by humanity blindly stumbling its way into the Information Age. “Professor Debayan would just throw random trivia at you and it would be your job to go back and study more about it. I cannot remember the number of wormholes I have gone down in based on what I learned in the class,” recalled Stuti. Young India Fellowship’s liberal arts pedagogy pushes students to explore the multiplicity of disciplines in an effort to shape them into well-rounded individuals with a holistic understanding of the world. Other courses that left a profound impact on Stuti were Shakespeare and the World offered by Professor Jonathan Gill Harris and Professor Madhavi Menon and Economic and Public Policy offered by A.K. Shiva Kumar.
The Experiential Learning Module (ELM) forms a core component of the YIF curriculum where the Fellows work in groups on real-world projects from diverse sectors in collaboration with partner organisations. For their ELM Stuti and her team worked with a biotech company and handled the post-production process (regulation, marketing, strategy, etc) of their new product—the UTI detection kit. “I loved my team because not only was it composed of passionate individuals who chose the project and each other but also because my peers came from such diverse backgrounds: one was a computer science engineer, one was a literature major and the other was an economist”, said Stuti. Over the last ten years of the YIF, projects have spanned diverse domains and sectors, including government and policy, entrepreneurship, social development, education, art and heritage, media and communications, and research among others.
Freshly out of the Fellowship, Stuti has been selected for the prestigious Unilever’s Future Leaders Programme (UFLP). An accelerated development programme designed to prepare future leaders for business roles, it gives graduates the opportunity to learn all about Unilever’s 400 diverse brands, business and sustainability efforts. Over a span of 12 months, Stuti will be placed in different roles across India to get experience in different sectors. “The Young India Fellowship quite literally prepared me for this. In a professional setting, you cannot just be like ‘Oh I don’t know this so I won’t do this’. That kind of attitude does not work in leadership positions. UFLP is sort of like an extended liberal arts education but in the business world” said Stuti. She asserts that liberal arts education has given her the required confidence to work across different roles and disciplines in an efficient and informed manner. “Coming from an engineering background, I never thought that I could ace a filmmaking course at YIF – but I did! This taught me so much about my own self and how if I put my heart and soul into something, there is no way I will not be able to achieve it”, she proudly exclaimed.
As Stuti looks back on her year-long journey, she says that the most important thing she is taking back is the newfound community that YIF has given her. “When driven individuals from across professional domains and geographical locations come together in one place—it is a powerhouse! Unlike my time at engineering school, the only homogenized experience that existed here was the sense of ‘family’ we felt towards each other. I know that wherever I go, I would be able to contact a YIF and they will welcome me with open arms.”

Entrepreneurship @ Ashoka in 2022
Prof. Priyank Narayan recounts all the significant entrepreneurial milestones of Ashoka University in 2022
Priyank Narayan30 December, 2022 | 4m read
“There are decades where nothing happens;
and there are weeks where decades happen”
~ Lenin
Our times have come to justify what Lenin said many decades ago. When we stepped into 2022, there was still fear and caution about the pandemic lingering around. We continued living our professional lives through the boxes on our screens for almost the entirety of the first quarter.
This was not much difficult for any as the inertia of WFH had already kicked in, the challenge was to break it, shun our pyjamas, and don a mask in a physical setting. There were students and colleagues who had started their journey with us virtually. It was an exciting period post the mid-sem break in March to finally meet them and get back into our work space and classrooms after two springs.
We had kickstarted the Spring Semester in January with a major uptick in the number of Entrepreneurship courses being offered. We were fortunate to have some of the pioneers and thought leaders in their respective fields teaching our students. From Pramod Bhasin, the Founder of Genpact doing a Leadership course to Raman Roy, a leader in the Indian BPO Industry and a prolific investor doing a course on How to Start a Startup. Then we had courses on the themes of digital transformation, real estate, finance, and investing added to our course catalogue. The trend of the Entrepreneurship course offerings going north continued for the Monsoon Semester in September with some amazing courses being offered in the areas of Leadership, Strategy, Finance, Digital Transformation, Management and Entrepreneurship. The number of students being engaged by us makes Entrepreneurship the biggest minor on campus. Our courses even attracted staff and alums who sit through them. I am particularly proud of a first-year student who spent her Monday evening voluntarily attending Aditya Ghosh’s In Pursuit of Service Excellence course. An alumnus travelled all the way from Gurgaon to attend the same class. It is these acts of dedication and determination that keep us going, and act as an assurance that we are on the right track.
As always, our courses had learning components even beyond the classroom through late-night Dhaba conversations with the faculty and guest speakers, field trips, and real-life immersive assignments where the students had the opportunity to gain hands-on experience through directly working with organizations, running live social media marketing campaigns, conducting sales research on the field, and even minting NFTs. A highlight of this year was the Dinner with Founders where our students could interact with Ashoka University founders like Ashish Dhawan, Pramath Raj Sinha, and Aditya Ghosh interact with students in an informal setting, singing along with them while strumming the guitar.
Another gratifying moment this year for us has been to see so many of our Entrepreneurship students acknowledging that their experiences with us have immensely contributed to their success during the Placement Season.
We continued empowering and supporting student-led initiatives on campus through various clubs like the Entrepreneurship Club and the Business Club, better known on the campus as E-Club and B-Club, besides assisting the Ashoka Investment and Consulting Clubs. They have surely been able to enhance the level of engagement on campus through their various intra as well as inter-institution events.
Supporting the startup founders and the startup ecosystem is of prime importance to us. The Startup Incubation Lab and the Entrepreneur-in-Residence programs witnessed Ashokapreneurs (student and alum startup founders) being systematically supported by mentors like Srikant Sastri, the President of TiE Delhi-NCR. We also participated in initiatives to strengthen the startup support ecosystems locally as well as globally.
Collaboration is a cornerstone of Entrepreneurship, and we were able to contribute to some interesting initiatives like the Panchkula Urban Dialogues with the Government of Haryana and the Registrar’s Office, Inclusion Through Innovation: Designing Barrier-free Environments with the OLS, and an L&D initiative for the staff and a fun staff after hours with the HR.
As Entrepreneurship at Ashoka progressed in leaps and bounds, there was a personal high for me in 2022. My book, ‘Leapfrog: Six Practices to Thrive at Work‘ co-authored with Prof. Mukesh Sud was published by Penguin India. It lays down six evidence-based insights to help readers advance their careers at an incredible pace.
In 2023, as we look to reinforce our various offerings including our courses, we would strive to promote and practice Human Centered Entrepreneurship and live the Ashoka Sutra values. We definitely want the weeks of 2023 to become fruitful, and help us set even higher benchmarks for ourselves. May 2023 in the pages of Ashoka’s history be a period where a ‘decade’ happened.

Inaugural Rakesh Jhunjhunwala Memorial Lecture held in Mumbai
The keynote address was delivered by Mr Uday Kotak, Managing Director and CEO of Kotak Mahindra Bank.
Office of PR & Communications7 August, 2023 | 4m read
Ashoka University hosted the inaugural Rakesh Jhunjhunwala Memorial Lecture in Mumbai on Wednesday, August 2. The keynote address was delivered by Mr Uday Kotak, Managing Director and CEO of Kotak Mahindra Bank. The event was attended by over 280 people from the business and finance world.
In his address, Mr Kotak listed out 10 commandments for the country as India approaches its 100th year of independence. The points included focus on sustainability, building world-class educational institutions, strengthening the judiciary, building a robust CSR environment, encouraging efforts to make the Indian Rupee a global reserve currency, building a strong military power, achieving a current account surplus, democratisation of technology, enhancing soft power and making India an attractive destination for global citizens.
“Rakesh was great company and a man of very bold thinking. Very often, for a long time in his career, he was underestimated in terms of his insights into analysis and stocks. People in the early stages thought this is one more player in the market without realising the deep analysis and insights which were truly unique,” said Mr Kotak.
The naming of the Rakesh Jhunjhunwala School of Economics and Finance took place earlier this year to honour one of Ashoka’s key architects.
During the naming of the School, Rekha Jhunjhunwala, wife of Late Rakesh Jhunjhunwala said, “My husband’s dream was to build a world-class university in India for which he supported Ashoka University from its inception. It is a proud moment for me to see this dream being fulfilled and realised through the naming of the top Economics School in India as the Rakesh Jhunjhunwala School of Economics and Finance. There is no better way to celebrate his legacy.”
“We are very grateful to Rakesh bhai and his family for his contribution and support, and of course, for his evangelism. We wanted to pay a tribute to him not just through the naming of the school but also through an intimate portrayal of the man himself – the investor, the philanthropist and who, above all, held an unwavering belief in India and cared passionately for the country,” said Pramath Raj Sinha, Chairperson, Board of Trustees, Ashoka University.
The Economics faculty at Ashoka has conducted research on a wide range of subjects in Economics, including Game Theory, Development Economics, Behavioural Economics, Econometrics, Applied Microeconomics, amongst others. The Economics department has been ranked first in research excellence in India, by Research Papers in Economics (RePEc) – the world’s largest collection of scholarly information for Economics and related disciplines.
“The idea of a Liberal Arts education is not just concentrated on giving students the basic skills to cope with life in whatever fields they go to, but also encourage a very broad-based education in all the branches of Social Science, Humanities and the Quantitative Sciences. Almost a third of the students at Ashoka choose subjects that are related to Economics and Finance. And this is why the Rakesh Jhunjhunwala School of Economics and Finance is so important to Ashoka University,” said Somak Raychaudhury, Vice-Chancellor, Ashoka University.,https://www.ashoka.edu.in/inaugural-rakesh-jhunjhunwala-memorial-lecture-held-in-mumbai/
India’s Leap into Space: Aditya-L1 Mission Unveiling New Horizons
"By becoming the third space agency ever to reach L1, ISRO will cement its position as one of the leaders in the global space race,” says Professor Somak Raychaudhury, Vice Chancellor, Ashoka University
“Coming closely on the heels of the success of Chandrayaan-3, the launch of the Aditya-L1 mission is a display of serious intent by ISRO to demonstrate India’s prowess in space flight, engineering and research. For the first time, India will have an indigenously built space-based solar observatory, launched to reach a parking space that is 1.5 million kilometres away from our planet. This is one of the most complex missions undertaken by the Indian establishment, requiring highly intricate manoeuvres to correctly place the spacecraft into a halo orbit at the Lagrangian Point 1 (L1) between the Earth and Sun, taking advantage of the competing gravitational pulls of the two bodies. The mission will simultaneously study the relation between events on the Sun’s surface and the corresponding changes in the Sun’s corona, seeking to understand why the corona is more than a million degrees hot. It will also study the ejection of highly energetic charged particles from the Sun and their effect on planets, in real-time, in order to build an early-warning system for solar storms that can cause serious damage to Earth- bound satellites, our communication systems and electrical grids. It will also help us understand how the ultraviolet radiation from the Sun impacts our climate. By becoming the third ever space agency to reach L1, ISRO will cement its position as one of the leaders in the global space race.”

Minting NFTs
This piece does not enlighten you about what an NFT is. However, if you have been interested in reading about NFT minting & some hands-on experience of first time NFT minters, then definitely give it a read
Entrepreneurship Education is not just about class lectures but also includes hands-on exercises, teamwork, real-life interactions, and thinking outside the box in many other ways to provide an immersive learning experience to the students.
During the Monsoon Semester 2022, for the Metaverse Decoded course by Jaspreet Bindra, the course participants were given a unique team-based assignment. They had to create a piece of art – painting, drawing, music, video, photograph, or collectible. Mint it as an NFT (non-fungible token) on any platform/marketplace/site and put it up for sale.
In this blog, we shall share with you how two teams went about the assignment. Below are mentioned excerpts from their assignment reports. A unique feature of the assignment was that the individual contributions of the team members had to be enlisted along with learnings from the process of minting NFTs.
Team 1: DeFi.Nomists
Context for Team Name: The core of this assignment is Decentralized Finance (DeFi); Nomists comes from the Greek word nomos, meaning law or principle (as used in Economists).
Group Members: Ankit Sharma, Harsha Mini, Nidhi Munot, Pranav Wali, Reeya Gupta, Samarth Jain, Twinkle Madke, and Vansh Jogani
The Process: We divided ourselves into four sub-groups, minting one NFT each. We wanted to mint different types of content into NFTs to see the differences in the minting process if any and test out the different platforms to check if they influenced the NFT’s performance. The wallets used were MetaMask and Metasky (which were created for free).
1. Harsha and Samarth (physical artwork):
Mintable– a gasless store was a viable option that allowed us to mint without paying gas fees upfront. This made minting the NFT free of cost since additional fees were only factored in once the NFT was sold. The reselling of the NFT on the platform provides a 10% royalty to primary owners, creating a revenue stream from future transactions.
We took a picture of Harsha’s physical artwork called “Parallel Realities” and minted it on the Ethereum Blockchain. We opted for the listing to be auctioned instead of choosing a fixed price because, without appraisal of the NFT, we were unsure of the price to assign to the piece. The minimum bid was 0.01 ETH (around $14.96), with it now priced at 0.013 ETH. The NFT received a total of 31 views.
NFT Link: Parallel-R… NFT for sale at Mintable.app
2. Nidhi and Reeya (digital artwork):
Since digital art pieces are one of the most popular types of NFTs that have a growing market of both buyers and sellers, we decided to mint and sell a digital art piece made by Nidhi on the OpenSea platform. A Metamask wallet was created to try tokens besides Ethereum MainNet, which otherwise are expensive.
We used the Polygon Blockchain Network and the Matic MainNet token. We then used a thematic supply faucet to generate some funds; a free site that provides small amounts of free tokens. We linked the wallet to an OpenSea account and minted the piece titled ‘Sunset at Sea Link’, which we listed for sale at a fixed price of 1 ETH. The NFT received 5 views.
The caveat with OpenSea is its large number of undifferentiated verified sellers, which would at least partially explain the low number of views.
3. Ankit and Pranav (video):
Apart from digital and physical art, we also wanted to explore mp4s/gifs as NFTs. To sell a video NFT, we realized we needed something of sentimental value or something buyer-interest-centric. So we chose a clip from the Ashoka Premier League (Ashoka’s annual intra-university football league) of a last-minute goal in the finals.
We looked at the best websites for mp4s/gifs and uploaded the NFT titled “freekickapl” on OpenSea. The NFT was publicized through social media and word of mouth to create hype and generate traction among the Ashokans. A fixed price of 0.0004 ETH (around 0.62USD) was set and we received an offer. Alternatively, an auction might have been set up given that the NFT holds value in the Ashokan context. However, it might not have generated enough participation from the general Ashokan body, owing to the lack of knowledge/interest in DeFi. We marketed this to the goal-scorer, who was willing to pay the gas fee only if we made this a series. We are currently looking to mint it on arbitrum in order to save gas fees while still maintaining Ethereum which is a great ecosystem.
4. Twinkle and Vansh (whitelist):
Curiosity made us attempt whitelisting—an NFT minting mechanism which allows a list of individuals guaranteed early access to mint. Whitelists are created by organizations to reward early and consistent supporters, prevent gas wars and stop spam by fake accounts.
We got whitelisted for the record label AZRV’s NFT on the NEAR Blockchain, which uses less energy compared to other blockchains, making it easier and more efficient for minting. With this NFT, we obtained early access to their upcoming music, live tour and community-only art events along with exclusive access to the discord channel with other AZRV NFT owners. This channel provided regular updates on the label and its artists. It also gave us a platform to interact with like-minded supporters of the label. However, although the NFT comes with multiple perks, we are not allowed to sell it yet.
Challenges:
- For Mintable, the categories and subcategories were very broad. The reach of the piece could have been improved with more specificity. Sellers had the option to add tags, but buyers could not search for them in the dropdown while searching for NFTs.
- OpenSea doesn’t allow filtering. If the feature were present, it would have added more relevance to the listing. Additionally, there were no tags that could be attached to the listing to increase reach.
- The dearth of an NFT appraisal mechanism led us to highly overvalue or undervalue our NFTs.
- Gas price fluctuation resulted in constant changes in pricing; this causes lower-valued NFTs to have lower saleability.
- Uncertainty about which platform had better reach and a relevant buyer market for the listed NFTs.
- The consequence of being a new and unverified user was low viewership of the listed NFTs.
- Creating a utility of the NFTs beyond the resales.
Improvements:
- We could have used “boosts” to increase the visibility of our NFTs on the platforms. However, we didn’t as it requires payment.
- We could have created a collection of NFTs, which would provide greater utility and value when compared to NFTs sold individually. In the Ashokan context, if we had created a collection of NFTs related to the campus, Ashokans would likely assign greater value to those NFTs. We could also attach intangible benefits to this collection (e.g. priority access to slot-sign-ups for the piano room).
- Platform Visibility and Relevancy: To better understand which platform works best for a particular type of NFT we could have compared the visibility of different platforms by listing similar pieces of content on different platforms with similar tags, and then comparing the reach. Offer prices could also be a metric for comparison.
Team 2: Built to Mint
Group Members: Abhirup, Abhiir, Anusha, Megha, Nikhil, Prabhav, Zorawar
We all contributed to the initial brainstorming, discussions, and final report writing process. In addition to this, our contributions are:
Abhirup: Compiled 21 NFTs to create 3 distinct collections on OpenSea and contributed 6 NFTs of my own – photography, digital art and composed the music NFT ‘Voyage’ (https://opensea.io/BuiltToMint) – Combined ~ 200 views.
Abhiir: Uploaded wildlife-specific NFTs, explored other platforms like Rarible, and marketed collections through Instagram stories.
Anusha: Created a piece of GenArt (via code), and minted it on Mintable (GenArt) to explore that platform (~50 views). For the Ashoka-themed collection – clicked pictures of the sky from different places around campus.
Megha: Created ‘The Ashokan Artist’ NFT portfolio https://opensea.io/The_Ashokan_Artist to showcase original digi-art made by students from the University.
Nikhil: Attempted to create an NBA NFT equivalent by minting moments from Ashokan Sporting Tournaments (Ashoka University – Sports – Collection | OpenSea) – Combined ~50 views.
Prabhav: Found satirical content in Ashokan and non-Ashokan contexts to create 6 NFTs; marketed all collections through a campus-wide email.
Zorawar: Drafted the campus-wide email.
Introduction
When Built to Mint was given the task of minting an NFT, we were initially apprehensive about it. None of us had any experience in this domain and were puzzled about how to actually ‘mint’ an NFT and makes it perform well. What this project showed us was that creating NFTs and crypto wallets is far simpler than we had thought and that there are a lot of factors that determine an NFT’s price, popularity, and ultimate value.
The Minting Process
Our apprehensions regarding NFT marketplaces being complex were debunked when we realized that minting an NFT takes less than 5 minutes! All platforms allowed us to simply choose and upload whichever item we wanted.
We realized early on that getting a random piece of art to gain traction would be challenging. On every major platform, the NFTs that seemed to be doing well:
- Had been uploaded by a verified user.
and/or
- Had a story woven around them in a way that made the artwork significantly more appealing to the audience.
These platforms have an algorithm like Instagram where verified profiles with the characteristic blue tick tend to perform better, in terms of views and favourites. Becoming a verified creator takes time, and since it was impossible for us to become one so soon, it was clear that for our NFTs to perform well, they needed to be a part of a larger narrative. Therefore, we chose a close-to-home theme to work with – Ashoka. We created a collection of NFTs titled ‘Inside Ashoka University’ where we uploaded images ranging from the famous Sonepat skies to the infamous Ashokan eating habits.
Secondly, to broaden our horizons, we curated a collection titled ‘A Lil’ Something for Everyone’ consisting of photographs (ranging from satire to wildlife), digital clip art, and an original piano composition titled ‘Voyage’.
We decided to mint all items on OpenSea as it is arguably the biggest NFT marketplace currently. More importantly, it doesn’t charge creators any minting fees (‘gas money’). Creators only pay a small percentage of the sale price, if and when an NFT is sold. Our pricing strategy was to compare the prices and quality of different forms of art on the platform (videos/audio/images), and then decide our price points based on the competition we faced. We ended up setting the prices extremely low, with most of them being around 0.0005 ETH (approximately 65 INR – less than the cost of a sandwich on campus!).
In addition to OpenSea, we experimented and minted some art pieces for free on platforms like Mintable, Rarible etc. For example, on Mintable, we minted the following GenArt, ‘Abstract Colourful Lines’.
Viewership
To ensure that our Ashoka-specific NFTs perform well, we sent an email to the entire student body with the links to all the account profiles across the platforms we used.
We also shared them through Instagram stories and leveraged our personal connections to boost viewership. Additionally, we got to learn how using listing tags on NFT platforms can be helpful. By using these, our views for the Mintable NFT went up from around 2-3 to 20 within just 2 days.
Of all the OpenSea NFTs, we noticed that the music NFT, Voyage, witnessed the greatest increase in views. As of 5th November 2022, Voyage stood at 38 views, while Abstract Colourful Lines on Mintable at 49 views.
Key Learnings
From the NFT minting process, we learned that the story mattered far more than the NFT itself. A digital creation has no tangible value of its own. People assign value based on the creator and the story behind it, not necessarily its aesthetic quality.
Why is it that a pixelated crypto-punk sells for $7,560,000 while a digital doodle of the Northern Lights by an Ashokan student gets hardly any? The former has a story that has captured the collective fancy. It is known as one of the 9 alien punks, making it an extremely rare piece.
Additionally, an exciting insight for us was that through NFT marketplaces, we can potentially monetize and profit from any piece of art in our surroundings as long as it is unique and has a story behind it.
What could’ve been done differently
Looking back, after going through the entire process, we think we could have boosted our NFTs’ performances by:
- Conducting better research into the trends and purchasing behaviours of users in NFT marketplaces to understand which category of art performs the best.
- Starting marketing our NFTs immediately after minting them.
- Exploring NFT forums on Reddit, Discord, etc to increase our viewership.
- Focusing more on weaving a story behind each NFT, to allow users to form personal connections.
Recommendations for Platforms
While minting an NFT is quite simple, purchasing one isn’t. For Indian customers, the first step to owning an NFT from a marketplace like OpenSea is to transfer Ethereum from a popular Indian wallet like WazirX to MetaMask, as OpenSea doesn’t allow direct transactions. This costs significant gas fees. For example, while our NFTs in rupees cost about 80-100 INR, the gas fee is more than 1000 INR. Moreover, even if Indian consumers begin with Metamask, the minimum transaction amount for buying ETH is $30 (≈2500 INR). Such costs disincentivize potential buyers to purchase NFTs, especially low-cost ones.
Another point of concern on OpenSea is that although uniqueness is the defining feature of NFTs, there are no authenticity checks to ensure that an item has not existed on any other platform. Mintable, on the other hand, does run such checks and provides buyers with links to other similar items found on the internet. Therefore, this is an area where OpenSea can improve.
Hope you enjoyed going through the blog and learnt how NFTs can be minted & which platform works best for you. Happy Minting!

My Tryst with Entrepreneurship at Ashoka: A journey of deep gratitude
In this gratitude blog, Kavya reflects on her Ashoka journey and Entrepreneurship’s impact on it. Having donned multiple hats as a student from starting and leading a club to assisting in the delivery of courses, Kavya is set to join McKinsey soon
The InfoEdge Center for Entrepreneurship has greatly aided my journey through Ashoka and beyond. I could not have imagined where it would take me when I sat to attend my first entrepreneurship course. I was your typical second year at Ashoka; confused about my career after college with no idea what the corporate world involved beyond corner offices and pencil skirts. Furious googling, frantic phone calls to seniors and many existential crises later, I stumbled into the department’s introductory offering of Entrepreneurial Marketing and Finance. I saw it as a way to dip my toes into this unknown world and hopefully gain some clarity on my skill set.
The course delivered over and above what I had expected. Not only did I discover how fun the problem-solving aspect of the fields we studied could be, but I also discovered opportunities that went beyond the classroom. It led me to my next course in entrepreneurship, Cultivating an Entrepreneurial Mindset where the classroom was fertile ground for new ideas and introduced me to people who were just as excited about them as I was. The enthusiastic peer group that the department provides compels you to pick up on essential soft skills. This includes the ability to clearly and effectively communicate your ideas in a classroom bursting with opinions. The journey turns classmates into teammates, friends, and eventually even co-founders. The Centre gave us the opportunity to start a business club on campus, and I am proud to say that the Ashoka Business Club (ABC) is now a year old and thriving. The ABC hosts events, guest sessions, field trips and a vibrant learning community that contribute to my growth every day!
The coursework and club introduced me to a wide range of ideas and perspectives, which helped me think creatively and outside the box. Looking back, I realize that this was crucial during my placement process, especially for consulting firms like McKinsey, which value creative problem-solving, entrepreneurial initiative and innovative thinking. These experiences also taught me practical skills such as market research and pitching. Moreover, they gave me a deeper understanding of how businesses operate, and how to identify and solve problems. This knowledge is critical for consulting and is often what interviewers look for during the placement process.
The most important learning from these experiences, however, was confidence. University life, especially in the middle of a pandemic, has the ability to make you question your every move. It is not easy to shake it off and move on. When you are sitting for 10 interviews a day and facing rejections, dismissive responses and sometimes pure disinterest, it is imperative that none of them shakes you. The opportunities I have been given through the Centre have given me the ability to pose a confident front through the placement cycle and eventually win over potential employers.
I am deeply grateful to the Center for Entrepreneurship and the mission it has undertaken. The Centre has provided me with opportunities that have helped me grow in countless ways. Through the various programs and resources offered, I have gained valuable experience and knowledge about the corporate world. I have had the chance to network with industry professionals I would not have dreamt of meeting, let alone having conversations and gaining advice from. The Centre has also provided me with a sense of community and support and I am forever grateful for the impact that the staff and community have had on my growth. These learnings have helped kickstart my career and will stay with me all the way till that corner office and pencil skirt collection is actually mine!

My Tryst with Entrepreneurship at Ashoka: Experiencing entrepreneurship differently
This piece takes a look at the journey of Ayush as an entrepreneurship student at Ashoka and how it has helped shape his professional journey
I remember someone telling me in my first year that Entrepreneurship cannot be taught. I think they are right. It has to be experienced through real-time projects, simulations and real-world case studies. I believe that to be an entrepreneur one must have multiple skills and a specialization in a few. There’s so much that an entrepreneur has to understand and then make decisions accordingly. My experience with entrepreneurship at Ashoka has been deeply rewarding and enriching.
My first entrepreneurship course was Dr Priyank’s Creativity and Design Thinking Course. This was the beginning of my journey. I learnt about various models in design thinking, which is a very powerful way to solve problems. At the end of the day, an entrepreneur is a problem solver, who’s solving product, marketing, finance and so many other problems in their startup. The course allowed me to explore the fields of behavioural science and user experience design. I spent the next year working in the field and learning hands-on in startups.
Then I did some courses on Marketing and Brand Building, which allowed me to understand how great brands are built and why marketing is so crucial. Using the learnings, I was able to work on the brand building of the podcast and small educational startup I was working on. I also did Nish’s Digital Professional Course, which taught me industry skills to run digital marketing campaigns.
It was because of all these courses that I was able to get exposure to how the real world works and what skills are valued. During the summer, I worked as an Entrepreneur-In-Residence at a health supplements startup, which allowed me to use all the things I had learnt in these courses. It was an enriching experience as I was able to add a lot of value to the strategy and execution of various verticals in the company.
My last semester has been particularly very interesting. There were so many courses and across functions. The four courses allowed me to further expand and deepen my knowledge in areas of finance, business analysis, sales, distribution, marketing and branding. It also allowed me to understand how great businesses are created and what factors govern that.
Overall, my experience has been quite rewarding, considering the applicability of the skills I learnt in these courses. Although it didn’t make me an entrepreneur, but my overall business acumen has improved a lot. It has also allowed me to excel at different skills that an entrepreneur needs to make a startup successful.
Running a successful startup is dependent on multiple factors, some of which are in our control and some not. What entrepreneurship at Ashoka has allowed me to do is give me more control of the factors that are in our control.

My Tryst with Entrepreneurship at Ashoka: From doubt to delight
From commencing her entrepreneurship journey during the pandemic to becoming a co-founder, Aditi shares her experience with entrepreneurship at Ashoka University
“If you can’t keep your cameras on and maintain eye contact with the screen for three hours, please drop out. There is a long list of students waiting for a seat in this course.”
Overwhelmed, I made up my mind to drop out once the class got over.
Hi, I am Aditi, and back then, I was a second-year Computer Science Student at Ashoka University. In my fourth semester, I stumbled upon my first entrepreneurship course, Cultivating an Entrepreneurial Mindset, taught by Prof. Mukesh Sud, one of the most loved visiting faculty from IIMA.
The class was very different from any other class I had taken at Ashoka or outside on three counts:
- It was participation heavy: During the class discussions, students not just interacted with the professor but students also interacted with other students
- We went through interesting case studies like that of PayTM, the making of Ashoka University, and more
- We were also expected to submit a one-pager before each class addressing a question from the case that we thought was most relevant
Coming from my very theoretical Computer Science classes with barely any cameras on, having such a lively class with so much class participation was a foreign concept for me.
The 3-hour experience turned out to be so much fun that I decided to change my mind and stick to this course, thus, marking the beginning of my very rewarding and interesting journey of Entrepreneurship at Ashoka.
One major learning at Ashoka has been to always try – either we win or we learn, so I went ahead and applied for it. I am so glad I did because becoming the representative turned out to be one of the best decisions I have taken in life so far.
I was also lucky to be chosen when the department was scaling from three courses in a semester to 17, thus allowing me to contribute a lot more. From interacting with 300+ students and understanding their needs to conducting the first-ever Entrepreneurship Mixer, my tenure started on a very high note.
I got the opportunity to work closely with the entire team at the Department of Entrepreneurship—Prof. Priyank, a mentor, a friend and a guide; Ekanto, my go-to problem solver for anything and everything; Sagar, a jack of all trades; Manoj, the relatable genZ with the best jugaads. Working alongside a team that is incredibly approachable, creative, and open-minded provided me with an exceptionally fulfilling experience.
In this journey, I was lucky to also learn from the brightest minds from across the industry and pick their minds on various topics and the latest industry trends. Our founders—Ashish Dhawan, Sanjeev Bikhchandani, and Dr Pramath Raj Sinha; and professors—Raman Roy, Sridhar Sethuram, and Yash Gupta were among a few of my favourites.
Being the Department Representative (DR) not only opened my doors for any opportunity I wanted to grab, but also accelerated my drive to solve problems, take initiative, and build things from scratch.
Not to forget, Shivansh—my Co-DR. From being a random irritating acquaintance to becoming one of my favourite people at Ashoka, the Department also gave me friends that I will keep for a lifetime. Given our love for trying new things, I always had a partner in my many experiments, be it with a new venue for the mixer, a South Indian food menu from an Ashoka Startup over the regular Chicago pizza, making students entrepreneurially speed date on a staircase, or prompting founders to share the worst investment they have made—WE DID IT ALL!
In retrospect, I wonder why I was chosen to be the representative in the first place. One of the biggest reasons was probably the club that I had co-founded: Lang-up.
It was supposed to be a college community for language learners but given the drive that the Entrepreneurship department ignited in me, the club ended up being my ground for a lot of experimentation. From doing language meet-ups in six languages, developing our first website, launching a newsletter, screening movies, and collaborating with 20+ clubs on campus, to making a Lang-up Film, pitching the idea at various platforms and setting up a booth at the Convention of Digital Entrepreneurs (CODE), India’s Largest Digital Conference—Lang-up became my passion project.
It was impossible to keep Lang-up going at such a high pace without CfE’s support. CfE did not just give me the space to brainstorm all the ideas I had for Lang-up, but also supported me in the tiniest of ways possible – be it by allowing me to use the CfE classroom to screen the Lang-up film or giving me munchies to show their support.
Lang-up has also been lucky to have gained mentorship from Prof. Srikant Sastri, as part of the course, Startup Incubation Lab. Over 13 weeks, we got a clear idea of how to position Lang-up, the TG (read target group) we wanted to target, how to pitch, calculate the TAM (read Total Addressable Market), and more. During this time, we worked on our first deck, talked to 100+ potential users, and pivoted our idea from an-in person college-wise language learning community to an activity-based digital language community for self-learners.
I wanted to become a Teaching Assistant since my first semester at Ashoka; it was one of those bucket list things that I wanted to tick off. Finally, in my sixth semester, I got my first ever TAship with Prof. Priyank for his course, Creativity and Design Thinking. The experience exceeded my expectations to the maximum. From looking through 20+ design books to choose the best seven, taking my first class on Biomimicry, my first shot at grading, to preparing a dance performance for the class with 10 of my students, and talking to my students to get their feedback in person, I learnt how TAship can be enriching, fun, and rewarding at the same time.
Thrilled by this experience, I then got the opportunity to TA for Professors Shantanu & Nitin for their course, Strategies for Market Access, in Monsoon 2022.
This TAship was a little different from my previous experience— a smaller class size, a lot more guest speakers, and professors who specially travelled to Ashoka to teach the course. Apart from the usual responsibilities as a TA, I also had the pleasure of coordinating the one-on-one sales trip for 25 students with representatives from seven different companies, including Pidilite, Kohler, and Ceat among others. It was a one-of-its-own kind of opportunity for students to shadow a salesperson for an entire day. When the students learnt tips and tricks to be great salespersons, I learnt to deal with things that appear to be a logistical nightmare.
I am very grateful to know Professors Shantanu and Nitin. They always supported and hyped up every initiative I took—my weekend solo trips, cracking an internship that I wanted. Our WhatsApp group soon became a platform for not only work discussions but also updates on anything significant that happened in my life.
CfE’s support has extended to a lot more things than expected. For any initiative I took, the Centre was a lot more excited and enthusiastic about it than I was. Be it my participation in Jagriti Yatra—a 15-day train journey around India to understand the roots of entrepreneurship, or doing a vodcast series with entrepreneurs from Shark Tank India Season 1 to reach a wider audience through the sharktankindia.com domain.
I have not only become a lot more confident but have also learnt to optimize for experiences.
I am forever indebted to CfE for the opportunities it has given me and for the person I have become today. Undoubtedly, the InfoEdge Centre for Entrepreneurship has been the best part of my Ashoka life.
Graduating with more than nine Entrepreneurship courses on my transcript, a great community of super-smart peers and experts from all around the world, and an amazing CfE team to fall back on, I am excited to conclude my rewarding tryst with Entrepreneurship at Ashoka.

My Tryst with Entrepreneurship at Ashoka: Learning about myself and the world
Rohan Manoj shares his experience of choosing Entrepreneurship courses in his last year and the impact it has had on him and his outlook
My tryst with Entrepreneurship at Ashoka has been one of adventure, going out of my depth to attempt to try something that I had never come close to trying before and doing it with people that may be “Smarter” or have more knowledge of the subject field. I’d never done entrepreneurship before this semester began and didn’t know what to expect but decided to go for it and see after the first semester of the year whether I wanted to continue or not, while the first semester of the year had its ups and downs, moments where I wondered if it was truly for me, if I was good enough, if it was worth it, the answer to all those questions were definitely yes and I wanted to continue to pursue a minor and so much more. I’m unsure of whether I want to be an entrepreneur or start my own venture, however, I quickly realized entrepreneurship at Ashoka isn’t about wanting to startup by yourself, but is more about building the entrepreneurial mindset in an individual and preparing you for the outside world and these are skills that any organization would want, and in this regard, I learnt more in my one semester about myself and being a leader than I had in the entirety of the previous 21 years of my life.
This past semester I had taken 3 Entrepreneurship courses – Leadership Lessons from the Road Less Traveled, Venture Planning and Strategy, and Understanding Law for Entrepreneurs.
During my time on the road less travelled, the takeaways that I have had from Professors Sunil Handa and Rashmi Bansal supersede that comfortably. I’ve felt more empowered and confident in myself when I have heard their stories notwithstanding the fact that even a lot of the guest speakers that we hosted, had turned to them for help. Now that I see myself towards the end of the course, I see the transformation in myself as a professional, thanks to the opportunities I’ve been given by the Entrepreneurship Department. One key takeaway that I will hold and spread about entrepreneurship at Ashoka is that whether you want to be an entrepreneur or not it’s important to take these courses because even if you do decide to work, the mindset of an independent entrepreneur is crucial.
Whereas another course I thoroughly enjoyed was Venture Planning and Strategy in which having been from a psychology background, I have spent a lot of time analyzing behaviour within scope, with there being an outcome which is expected or lines in between that we couldn’t escape. However, with this course, I felt encouraged to colour outside the lines, to express thoughts which might, as ridiculous as they sounded have some semblance of truth to how it worked if analyzed in the correct method. One aspect that I loved about the course was the analytical aspect, the fact that we were encouraged to think on our feet, the fact that with the case we were encouraged to come up with a one-pager for a question that may or may not exist and more than that the fact that we discussed all the aspects of our cases with our peers, and even the faces behind the cases at times, and that we weren’t discouraged from asking the hard-hitting questions.
Last but not the least, the third entrepreneurship course that I’ve done was one with the most mixed emotions. It wasn’t too taxing because it was on a Saturday. However, when it came to the contents of the course it was arguably one of the most interesting courses that I had done in the semester, in the sense, no other course covered the length and breadth that this course covered. As someone that has a vast interest in law and has had generations do law, it was of great insight to me and offered the privilege to learn from esteemed practitioners.
My tryst with entrepreneurship is something that I really do want to continue post my time at Ashoka and really do believe that a lot of the relationships I’ve made with the faculty will be relationships for life and I will be forever grateful for this. That is something the Entrepreneurship at Ashoka has done that no other department has been able to do.

My Tryst with Entrepreneurship at Ashoka University: From scepticism to belief
Abhiir Bhalla retraces his journey from being sceptical about Entrepreneurship in a Liberal Education setup to staying back the fourth year to pursue a Minor in Entrepreneurship
I was first exposed to Entrepreneurship at Ashoka during our online classes, where I had signed up for a pair of 2-credit courses to see what all the hue and cry was about. Admittedly, I was initially unimpressed. Amusingly enough, my first impression, particularly after Pramod Bhasin’s first class in his course ‘Theory & Practice of Leadership’ was that practitioners should remain in the industry and leave the teaching to Professors. This hasty judgement was soon revised when I realised the insights and unique perspectives our distinguished Professors had to offer, backed up by anecdotes that would leave you hanging off the edge of your seat. Eventually, I gave up Bhasin’s course in favour of Yash Gupta’s course ‘Real Estate & Investments’ since I only had the bandwidth for one course at the time; nonetheless, it was far from an easy decision to make and I promised to take up the former course again at some point in the future.
Being a student of Political Science, I was very keen to get back in touch with the business and financial world, since I’d always loved Economics but chose against pursuing it in college due to my fear of Calculus. I also realised very quickly that I was disillusioned in believing that studying political science would prepare me for my grand aspirations for my longer-term goal of a career in politics. While this wasn’t entirely untrue, I might argue that I’ve learnt more crucial life skills and practical knowledge in the course of the past 6-10 months than I did in my three years of Political Science.
Having taken up courses like ‘Business Communication & Negotiation’ and ‘Entrepreneurial Marketing’, I learnt a lot about the real-world implications of individual and institutional decisions. Courses like ‘Artificial Intelligence and Data Analytics’ and ‘Metaverse Decoded’ didn’t just provide me with an opportunity to learn new skills and actually understand so many ‘buzzwords’ that so many of us throw about without thinking, but also look at their practical applications – something which was a thorough miss for me in my three-years degree insofar.
That being said, me being the eternal sceptic that I am, I approached Entrepreneurship at Ashoka initially wondering what on Earth the university was up to by teaching business at a liberal arts school. My very first course with Professor Yash Gupta shattered this sceptical outlook – the man is nothing short of a genius. His course, along with Professor Jhangiani’s Marketing course, has to be, by far, amongst my top 5 courses at Ashoka across the four disciplines I’ve dabbled in. The cherry on the cake, of course, was the occasional glamour and glitz we were exposed to on our field trips – an integral part of almost every course.
Before I knew it, I had made up my mind to stay back for the fourth year and pursue a minor in Entrepreneurship (and no, it was not just for the fun beyond the classes). I did my major in Political Science, a minor in International Relations and a concentration in Media Studies – all in all, a diverse mix of disciplines. Surprisingly enough, it was Entrepreneurship courses that served as a silent and yet sturdy glue that bonded them together and created a complete picture for me.
I feel almost guilty to have once looked upon the department’s role at Ashoka with scepticism, given that the department almost feels like a third home for me at Ashoka now. The courses that have been offered (as well as the exciting upcoming line-up) have provided us with an opportunity that very few colleges in India – and perhaps even in Asia – would be able to offer. To learn from industry stalwarts and renowned academics such as Aditya Ghosh, Pramod Bhasin, Pawan Ahluwalia and Yash Gupta has been a privilege. I am eagerly waiting to don the hat of a UGTA and assist Prof. DVR Seshadri in the upcoming semester.

My Tryst with Entrepreneurship at Ashoka: What is Your Idea of a Perfect Workplace?
Avnie shares her experience with Entrepreneurship at Ashoka as a student and now at a workplace while being a startup founder too
As a student at Ashoka University, I was fascinated to find out that the university had something called the Centre for Entrepreneurship or CfE as it was called. Coming from a public university, with the fire of being an entrepreneur inside of me, a centre such as this one seemed too good to be true. I was part of the flagship program of the university – The Young India Fellowship, which gave me little time to do anything outside of the program. However, whenever I would get a chance, I would engage with CfE such as by participating in Startup Ashoka (I must mention that the learnings I got from just this 48-hour event guide me while I conduct workshops and programs to this day).
Fast forward, I work at CfE while I am penning this down. One fine day while I was working on Elucidation Today (a career coaching and skill development firm I founded), I received a message from a team member at CfE asking me if I would like to apply for a position here. This was a pleasant surprise and I was elated. However, I bought time. Thoughts on mind: CfE can offer me the stimulating environment I have been craving, I could be among entrepreneurs all the time, and work would be so much fun as anything I do would be about entrepreneurship which I love. But what about Elucidation Today? Would I be able to do justice to the time I need to invest in my firm? I discussed my role and time commitment at length with the team member from CfE who had approached me. CfE offered time flexibility for at least some days of the week. I would be in NCR which gives me the opportunity to network with great entrepreneurs in the capital. Considering these and other factors, I made up my mind and decided to pursue this opportunity. It also meant that I would have to leave my city and move to NCR. I quickly started looking for some employees who were willing to work from home for Elucidation Today and after weeks of search, I was able to find some good folks (great folks now that I know them more). I appeared for the interview at CfE. While the director seemed to like my profile, he was worried (as expected) about my time commitment. I remember him asking, “Avnie, you have a full-time firm to run. It’s like having a baby waiting for you back home. Will you really be able to manage your time?” I was impressed with his honest question and as the answer was crystalline in my mind, I was able to clear his concern.
CfE has offered me the flexibility at work I needed to work on Elucidation Today. In the initial few days of coming here, I got a fracture (and an eventual 8 weeks plaster cast) which has hampered my ability to get closer to my goal of networking but I am sure my upcoming months will offer me ample opportunities.
I have seen courses and engagement at CfE scale up exponentially. We have expanded from 2 courses a term to 20 a term. For the courses conducted at CfE, I love preparing the content to be taught, choosing the case studies to be circulated, guiding budding entrepreneurs, inviting and having discussions with some insanely successful entrepreneurs, assessing the assignments submitted, and of course, contributing to my alma mater in such a satisfying manner.
And things are not always rosy. I have had students fight with me because they scored less, faced last-minute ‘mic has stopped working’ issues, handled cases with just 15 students present in class (because it was Saturday evening) and a stellar faculty had to come to teach. But I call CfE a perfect workplace for me because all these experiences are shaping me into a better individual and team player (ah, I work in a team where we are there helping each other out all the time). My CfE experience is bringing out the entrepreneur in me in ways I could never have imagined. Most importantly, our director makes me feel that I am valued at my workplace. Do I need anything else?
Ending this with the treat a faculty member gave me. That’s a Subway wrap, chocolate cake (which by the way is by an Ashokapreneur and my fellow Teaching Fellow, Shubha Mahajan), and Pepsi can that you see in the picture.

Solving an enigma of nesting structures by nature’s architects
This research conducted by Prof Shivani Krishna and her team show how social wasps recognize emergent topological defects
ফড়িঙের ডানাতেও এ জীবন দেয় ডাক
বেঁচে থাক সব্বাই, হাতে হাত রাখা থাক
— Kabir Suman, “Sara Dao” (in Bengali)
Life calls out even from a wild wasp’s wing
May everyone live, hold hands and always sing
— English adaptation by Prof Arunava Sinha
For centuries now, nests of social insects such as bees, wasps, and ants have attracted the attention of ecologists. In bees and wasps* cells within the nest are usually hexagonal. This preference to build hexagonal-shaped cells was attributed to compactness. Darwin himself conducted experiments to understand how bees built these structures. It is now well known that a hexagonal lattice is the most efficient way to divide a plane into regions of equal area with the least total perimeter (honeycomb conjecture).
How do hundreds of individuals come together and build a periodic hexagonal lattice? What happens when there are errors in this construction process or tiling? Polistes wasps nesting in large numbers on the Ashoka University campus, allowed us to address questions such as regularity in hexagons and how the wasps were arranging them in a natural environment. Polistes wasps are social wasp species that use plant fibers for their nest construction. Unlike honeybees that use wax, nesting material used by wasps is relatively difficult to manipulate.
This puzzle on how wasps correct any errors given their non-plastic structural material drew us to this problem. We then decided to take a closer look by bringing down some of the nests made by these wasps after they completed their nesting season.
We systematically collected nests, took images with a scale, identified the vertices of individual hexagonal cells from these images, and mapped them. Using these coordinates, we analyzed how homogenous these hexagons and their organization were in relation to a periodic hexagonal net. We found that the wasps carefully laid out hexagons such that there were no gaps in between. While analyzing this, we found something astonishing in their nests.
Mathematicians have worked on principles involving continuity and deformability. While these have gained attention in understanding basic phases of matter to cosmological patterns, they were never considered relevant in the context of social insect nests.
Shivani Krishna, Assistant Professor of Biology at Ashoka University discusses in her study published in the Scientific reports what it means to have non-hexagonal cells such as pentagons and heptagons in such nests. These pentagons and heptagons were also found to always co-occur in proximity. This seems to be a very ingenious way of ensuring planarity when errors occur. For some reason, during the construction process, when a pentagon occurs by mistake, the wasps cannot simply leave it as such if they wish to continue with the construction as this may lead to a curved structure (similar to a hat). On the other hand, if a heptagon occurs, the whole system tends to be saddle-shaped. In wasp nests, to ensure the nest remains planar without curvature or distortion, which incur the cost of more material and stability issues, the wasps add a heptagon adjacent to a pentagon and vice-versa.
This is an astonishing architectural feat, where wasps can avoid deviations from planarity in their nests by fixing non-hexagonal cells using geometrical rules known primarily from crystal structures, skyrmions, protein folding, viral outer coats, etc. This opens an exciting avenue of intriguing questions at the interface of ecology and physics, cutting across multiple scales.
*Wasp is a social winged insect that has a narrow waist and a sting and is typically yellow with black stripes.

The boy who dreamt beyond the stars
Aafaque R Khan, a Young India Fellow (YIF) from Ashoka's 2014 cohort, was one of the lead engineers in the Solar Ultraviolet Imaging Telescope (SUIT) payload aboard Aditya-L1
Aafaque R Khan distinctly remembers seeing four of Jupiter’s moons through a telescope as a child. The episode made him curious. By the time he was a teenager, he had spent countless nights on the terrace of his Ujjain home, trying to spot star clusters and galaxies through his home-made telescope. “Perhaps that was when I started to dream about building bigger, better telescopes and becoming an astrophysicist,” he says.
Over a decade later, Aafaque still has stars in his eyes and on his mind. A Young India Fellow (YIF) from Ashoka’s 2014 cohort, Aafaque is currently a graduate student and Future Investigator (FI) on Future Investigators in NASA Earth and Space Science and Technology (NASA-FINESST) Grant at the University of Arizona. At an age when most of his peers are still settling into a professional role, he has already etched his name in history.
After all, how many can claim to have played a part in their country’s first – and so far, only – mission for the Sun?
Aafaque R Khan was one of the lead engineers in the Solar Ultraviolet Imaging Telescope (SUIT) project aboard Aditya-L1 (India’s first solar mission designed and developed by ISRO). In layperson terms, he played a key role in building one of the major instruments on board the observatory – the telescope which will study the Sun’s atmosphere.
Landing this role, however, may have been destiny.
A mechanical engineer, Aafaque had planned to pursue higher education overseas. Having interned at Pune’s Inter-University Centre for Astronomy and Astrophysics (IUCAA) earlier, he reached out to the Centre for letters of recommendation. Instead, impressed with his dedication towards Astrophysics, the Centre offered him a job as a lead engineer for the Solar Ultraviolet Imaging Telescope (SUIT) project. The SUIT project is one of the primary ‘payloads’ or technological instruments of the Aditya-L1 mission. This is the first time full disk images of the Sun will be taken from space in the 200-400 nm wavelength range. These observations will help understand why the solar atmosphere is hotter than the surface. It will also help to keep a tab on the charged particles which can prove to be dangerous for satellites in space and satellite-based communication.
Aafaque recognised opportunities like these don’t come often. He was immediately on board.
“We (at IUCAA) were looking for young people with high aims for themselves and who could be trained on space projects. Aafaque came out as an obvious choice… He is very ambitious and hardworking. His excellent ability to work in a team and volunteer to take up complicated and leadership roles make him an exceptional personality. Aafaque would make every member of the team feel inclusive and unique. I vividly remember his flawless sailing through the ISRO system of working and contacting different stakeholders in the project,” shares Durgesh Tripathi, Professor at IUCAA and the Principal Investigator of the SUIT project.
Somak Raychaudhury, Vice-Chancellor, Ashoka University recalls, “I first met Aafaque when he was working on the design of the ultraviolet imager. I was then the Director of IUCAA and so, on a daily basis, saw how his work – and the whole project – took shape. A very innovative instrument was being built for India’s first venture into Sun-watching from space, and Aafaque was keenly aware of his leading role in this innovation. He held together a team of young and talented people working on such an important instrument with teamwork, close interactions with other members, and his own brand of humour.”
From 2015 to 2019, Aafaque dedicated his efforts to leading the end-to-end design and development of SUIT with various teams at IUCAA and ISRO. As a systems engineer, he was not just responsible for design details and technical problem solving, but also project management funding and systems engineering. All this, while being one of the youngest in a team of seasoned professionals.
“While I excelled at handling the steep learning curve and navigated the technical challenges, it was my critical thinking, leadership and problem-solving skills that helped me establish myself as the bridge between the science and engineering teams,” says Aafaque.
In 2019, Aafaque moved on from IUCAA to pursue higher education. He is currently in the fourth year of the Astrophysics PhD programme at Steward Observatory. His doctoral research focuses on advancement of UV detector technologies in collaboration with NASA-Jet Propulsion Laboratory and development of next-generation space-based astronomy missions. Aafaque is currently working on his next space telescope, Aspera, a NASA funded small satellite mission.
“When I first met Aafaque, I was struck by how involved he was with the SUIT project, and how much technical knowledge he had from working on it,” says astrophysicist Erika Hamden. Professor Hamden is an Associate Professor at Steward Observatory and Director of the University of Arizona Space Institute. She continues, “He had absorbed so many best practices, typical challenges, and was able to share that knowledge readily when needed. Likely due to his incredible curiosity, he seemed to know everything about the (SUIT) project, even components he didn’t work on. It was excellent preparation for all of his work in the lab here at Arizona, and we are really excited to see the instrument working in orbit soon!”
Looking back, Aafaque believes the YIF left an undeniable impact on his life. “The programme helped me develop the adaptability, vision and drive required to succeed in a highly-functioning team. The multidisciplinary education provided the ability to look at complex technical problems from different perspectives. Most importantly, YIF taught me that despite coming from a humble social and financial background, I can dream as big as I want and strive to achieve those dreams.”
Professor Somak Raychaudhury mirrors our sentiments when he says, “Aafaque’s journey inspires us to continue to shape young minds who dare to redefine the boundaries of possibility. Keep dreaming big, Aafaque. You have proven that even the sky is not the limit.”,https://www.ashoka.edu.in/the-boy-who-dreamt-beyond-the-stars/
The Only Ashoka Bucket List You Will Need This Year
As you venture on your unique journey as a university student, this bucket list is to help you capture the true Ashokan experience
My time at Ashoka University has made me realise one thing—Ashoka is much more than just a university, it is an experience. While I have thoroughly enjoyed all my classes, and they have taught me to look at the world with a fresh perspective, the memories that I have made outside the classroom are the ones that have profoundly carved my sense of community and have inculcated in me values of empathy, belongingness and friendship.
While some of these are traditions that have been passed down year after year, others are just experiences deemed necessary to call yourself a true Ashokan. As you plan on integrating (or reintegrating) amongst the red-bricked walls of Ashoka that harbour so much love and fraternity, these are just some of the ways to start scratching the surface:
- Soak in the sun while sitting in the mess laws: Ashokan students are found basking in the sun on the lawns opposite the mess building more often than they are found in their rooms during the day. Completely engrossed in a book or chatting their time away in the company of their friends, spending time in the Mess Lawns is an essential!
- Feed the dogs outside campus: Albeit they do not reside on the premises, the dogs outside the campus are as much a part of the Ashokan community as any of us! Go on your own or join Pawsitive as they venture out every evening to keep our furry friends happy, healthy and satiated.
- Get clicked with Toofan(s): Toofans are the fellow cats-in-residence at Ashoka. It is often said at Ashoka that you cannot come to Toofan because they are the ones who pick you! These cats coming to fellow students at random points of the day and showering them with love have made the days of so many Ashokans.
- Roll down the ‘hills’ of Ashoka: One thing that almost all Ashokans have done, often even multiple times, is rolling down the slopes leading up to the Sunken Field. A once-in-a-lifetime experience that promises to leave your clothes dirty and hair ruffled, this is one for the books!
- Post an Instagram story captioned #SonipatSkies: There is something about the serene skies of Sonipat that makes all residents come out with their phones in their hands at sunset. Featuring these vibrant skies of Sonipat on your Instagram is a must for all.
- Late-night dhaba excursion: Be it a night after a day of intense studying in the library or just a friendly reunion with your pals, a late-night Dhaba jaunt is a frequent occurrence for all Ashokans. With a wide variety of dishes on the table (I personally recommend the Honey Chilli Potato and the Chilli Garlic Butter Maggi), everlasting memories are made here.
- Cheer for your Home Team: Be it the Ashoka Premier League, Agneepath or the Batch Championship, sports always bring the entire Ashoka family together. With roars and cheers being heard from far-far away, coming together to support your favourite team is definitely on the bucket list.
- Run for your seat in the shuttle: Running all the way from your residence halls to the gate so that you do not miss the shuttle is barely a rare occurrence at Ashoka. Catching that breath of relief as you walk into a fully packed shuttle with all riders staring at you will be embarrassing, but worth it!
- Get a room plant from the nursery: Bring life to your new dorm room by choosing your house plant from a wide variety at the nursery! Give your new plant a name, plenty of water and sunlight and perhaps play it some of your favourite music and watch it bloom!
- Stay up all night to witness the sunrise: Be it from the sky bridge, the frisbee field or the comfort of your bedroom window—watching the magnificent sunrise will be an experience you will never forget.

Understanding how mistakes made while manufacturing proteins can be good
Dr Laasya Samhita, Assistant Professor of Biology at Ashoka University, elaborates on her research that aims to unravel molecular mechanisms linking translational errors and antimicrobial resistance
Yukti Arora14 September, 2022 | 6m read
Let’s start by talking about your research journey so far:
I sometimes think that biology was ‘the most boring subject’ taught in school, concentrating on drawing skills and mugging up various terms, with no real introduction to the subject at all. Other than exposure at home, the IISc (Indian Institute of Science) Young Fellowship and the Kishore Vaigyanik Protsahan Yojana (KVPY) were critical to my scientific growth.
After my Bachelor’s degree, I joined the Integrated Ph.D. program in Biological Sciences at IISc. Both during my Ph.D. and postdoctoral work as a DBT/Wellcome Trust India Alliance early career fellow, I was exposed to rigorous scientific training and a stimulating atmosphere of constant discussion.
You have been working extensively on mistranslation. What is the relevance and larger objective of this research?
I work at the interface of molecular biology and evolution. I try to understand how mistakes made while manufacturing proteins can affect cellular function. Specifically, work from my lab will try to understand how such errors contribute to survival in different environments, and in particular to antibiotic resistance in bacteria. We hope to start systematic mapping of environmental antibiotic resistance by surveying water samples from rivers.
Over time and with collaborations, this should help us link data from three real-world settings which often remain disconnected: the lab, the clinic, and the environment. It would also expand our understanding of the phenomena that lead to antibiotic resistance.
While we understand how DNA-based changes are transmitted across generations, the impact of protein-based changes on evolution remains poorly understood. Proteins are biomolecules responsible for carrying out most cellular functions, and their sequence and function is therefore very important to the cell. Mistakes made during the synthesis of proteins (mistranslation) lead to altered proteins, which are most often harmful but can also be beneficial when the cell is under stress.
Even though these altered proteins (unlike mutated DNA) cannot be transmitted to the next generation, mistranslation can impact several critical cellular functions including how genes are expressed, how fast they mutate, and various forms of stress resistance including resistance to antibiotics. From a fundamental science point of view, exploring information flow from protein to DNA (rather than DNA to protein) leads to an exciting new arena.
Antibiotic resistance is anticipated to be the next pandemic. Does mistranslation in microbes affect their resistance to antibiotics? What impact of this research do you envision?
From a human perspective, mistranslation-based changes in disease-causing microbes can cause serious health issues by making the microbes more antibiotic-resistant. By exploring such phenomena, I hope to expand our understanding of how such changes can impact evolution and also affect real-world problems such as antibiotic resistance.
In today’s post-pandemic atmosphere, we are all acutely aware that pathogens adapt in unexpected ways. Translation errors help organisms to exceed the coding capacity of their genomes and throw up a variety of novel phenotypes (observable physical properties of an organism), some of which are stable across generations and may contribute to virulence.
As technical advances facilitate a better understanding of molecular mechanisms in this nascent field, I am confident that we will understand and combat bacterial stress tolerance, and hence infections more efficiently. In the future, I hope that work from my lab can drive novel and diverse drug designs and help combat the global health problem of AMR.
Exploring the evolutionary impact of mistranslation is relatively a new area of research. What are the key technical/non-technical challenges that you may encounter?
There are several technical challenges. Matching a change in phenotype of an organism with one or more altered proteins is one. Disentangling genetic from epigenetic contributions to adaptation is another.
From the point of view of measuring non-genetic resistance to antibiotics, non-genetic resistance can arise in several ways; and there is no technique available for an overall identification and quantitative estimation of such phenotypes. The paucity of long-term data for clinical as well as environmental resistance trends means that correlating clinical with environmental and laboratory resistance remains a challenge. This is a roadblock that we hope to address in our work at least in part.
On a non-technical front as well, there are problems. The systems that support independent science researchers do not make it easy for anyone beyond a certain age. The age limits for applying to postdoctoral grants as well as during hiring is a hurdle for everyone, but it becomes increasingly difficult for women who have maternity-related breaks. There are now grants that specifically account for career breaks and give age concessions to women, and this is great, but the (often unstated) age rule during hiring at an early stage in your career can be very discouraging.
How will Ashoka help you in your professional journey and why did you choose to work at Ashoka?
Ashoka University has a diverse set of accomplished biologists whom I hope to learn from and collaborate with. I think one big plus about this institution has been its focus on independent thinking and experience rather than age limits.
My impression is that the University is driven towards investing in people as individuals. This creates a low-stress and supportive atmosphere, making it easier to discuss concerns regarding work-life balance. The flexible atmosphere, support for other daily activities, and generous funding nurture a creative space that I find quite unique in today’s science ecosystem in India.

An Evening with Neil George, MD, Nivea and a Comic Book Author
The InfoEdge Centre for Entrepreneurship at Ashoka University hosted Neil George, the Managing Director of Nivea India, on the 3rd of November, 2022. A report by Abhirup Chatterjee (ASP'23)
Neil was invited to deliver a talk titled “Let’s Talk Money – Pricing to Win” as a part of the course ‘Strategies for Market Access’ taught by Shantanu Bhanja and Nitin Chaudhry.
Starting the session with stories about Nivea’s German roots, Neil went on to talk about the Nivea culture, the stringent global safety requirements their products follow, what a day in the life of a Nivea salesperson looks like on the shopping floor, and lastly, Nivea’s go-to-market strategy in the Indian marketplace. To make things interesting, Neil posed questions for the students and every correct answer was rewarded with either a Nivea goodie bag or a signed copy of his own comic book ‘Building the Perfect Beast: What really happens in Brand Management’. Needless to say, audience participation was abundant.
Neil did an interesting giveaway. He asked the students as to who all have used Nivea products and most of the class raised their hands. Neil went on to ask which products the students had used. However, there was one student who didn’t raise their hand. Neil gave away a Nivea goodie bag to this student stating that from now on they can’t claim to have not used Nivea. Like a true brand ambassador of Nivea, he probably created a potential Nivea customer in class.
In a talk that lasted for more than an hour in the fully packed classroom, students got a glimpse into the ideas that have made Nivea the giant it is today in the Indian marketplace despite being significantly younger than its competitors. The biggest highlight of the session, perhaps, was when a student asked Neil for the story behind the comic book he has authored – a question that might have been on everyone’s minds given how very few managing directors can boast of having published a comic book.
The idea of writing a book on brand management had come to Neil after he had left Reckitt Benckiser and was on a break before joining a private equity firm in 2010. During this hiatus from consumer products, Neil had many people visiting him for advice on brand management, with many asking the same questions. To share his knowledge with many more, he felt his calling to write and publish a book- something he thought he would have never done in his life. It was only later, after considerable market research and brainstorming, that he realized that he could use his childhood expertise in comics to make one himself – something no one had done before for marketing books. However, there was only one small problem – Neil couldn’t draw.
After an extensive search around the internet, Neil found an artist based out of Moldova who could make a comic in the ‘Dark Art’ style he wanted. And thus, began a very successful relationship – one where Neil would send the artist the storyline for a chapter and the artist would draw the scenes. It was a long and arduous process where each page took up to a week to create! Slowly but steadily, in 3 years, Neil had managed to finish 8 chapters of the book with only a few left. All seemed to be going well when suddenly, the artist, whom Neil had never met, vanished into thin air.
With no response from the artist after numerous calls and emails, Neil felt dejected. He could try finding a new artist but there was no way another artist could recreate the style of the previous chapters. For the next 3 months, Neil shelved the idea. It was during this time he remembered his bosses from the past who would often tell him that he was full of great ideas but never good at executing any of them. Neil said this is what pushed him to complete the book and how keeping it shelved would only mean that his bosses were right about him. And so the search for artists began anew. This time, he found artists much closer to home – a duo named XongBros based out of Kolkata. This time, the process was much quicker and soon, Neil was back where he had lost the Moldovan artist. For this iteration, after some feedback from friends, he decided to create a few more chapters with more fantasy-like elements. Finally, the comic book was complete and the only thing left to do was to publish it. But that came with its own challenges.
“It’s a comic book” and “This won’t sell” were the frequent responses he was met with from publishers. Not willing to give up, Neil self-published despite naysayers declaring the project doomed. During this time, he reached out to Shantanu Bhanja for his help with marketing. He connected Neil with the current Editor-in-Chief of Hindustan Times, Sukumar Ranganathan. Sukumar featured him in an article in the Mint Magazine and before long, every media house was talking about the curious case of an MD who has self-published his own comic book. With such promotion across the country, it finally caught the attention of publishers. Soon enough, Harper Collins approached him and, as Neil recounted teary-eyed, a passion project that had started 8 years ago was finally published in December 2018.
And how did Neil celebrate this milestone? He mailed all his former bosses a published copy of his comic.
Neil for sure demonstrates some of the practices to thrive mentioned in the book Leapfrog by Prof. Priyank Narayan & Prof. Mukesh Sud, like Develop Grit – the art of endurance, Nudge Yourself – tricks that work for you, and Think Entrepreneurially – the audacity of asking.

Ashoka University Researchers Examine How Social Identities & Group Norms Shape Online Conversations
This research conducted by Prof. Sramana Majumdar and her team of students is one of the first social psychological investigations into computer-mediated communication in the Indian context. The findings emphasize on how online intergender communication is shaped by social identity norms and how that is reflected in conversations around feminism
Over the last few years, we have been constantly reminded of the rapidly growing influence of social media and computer-mediated communication (CMC). While some initial research on CMC indicates that anonymity and invisibility create an equalizing effect that can eliminate stereotypes and enhance interpersonal contact, there is increasing evidence to show that it may strengthen biases because of the increased group identification and in-group salient behaviors (group salience) and reduced interpersonal cues. This is what caught Sramana Majumdar’s attention, an Assistant Professor in the Department of Psychology at Ashoka University.
Having been interested in intergroup conflict and identity, it became apparent to her that to understand present-day group identities, norms, intergroup attitudes, prejudice, and conflict, one must adequately attend to what is happening on social media. There is a lack of psychological research, especially in understudied developing countries like India, which are also some of the largest consumers of digital media. This is what motivated Prof. Majumdar and her team of research students, including Maanya Tewatia, Devika Jamkhedkar, and Khushi Bhatia at the Identity and Intergroup Relations Lab to examine this space, from a social psychological and intergroup contact perspective.
The main aim of the project was to examine social media interactions among Indian users, from a social psychological perspective. The researchers wanted to understand how social identity and group norms were shaping online conversations, and if that was transforming how and what we feel about ‘others’ (other group members, who identified with a different religion, gender, region, language, or nationality).
A mixed-method project was designed to address multiple aspects of social media interactions. Firstly, online surveys were conducted to note individuals’ self-reports and observations about their interactions across gender and religion on major social media platforms. Secondly, a qualitative discourse analysis of posts and comments on public Facebook forums that featured conversations around feminism was performed. This was to further understand how gender norms were reflected in these conversations, especially in the usage of common online terms like pseudo-feminism, INCELS, Manosphere, etc. Lastly, through multiple experiments, researchers at Ashoka University measured how the valence (negative/neutral/positive) of online posts from members of other groups, and the degree to which an individual identified with their own group, would predict attitudes towards other groups.
From the qualitative study, it was discovered that speakers conflicted over the discourse of feminism in various ways, by using traditional as well as novel terms that refer to descriptive meanings of gender categories. These included new discourses within feminism (pseudo feminism, choice feminism.) and men’s rights (Incels, MGTOW). Flaming (the use of hateful and aggressive language) was also prominent, specifically in conversations around sex and sexual choice. Here, the threat to ingroup identity was met with reactive aggression. Lastly, interactions highlighted several challenges to established meanings of feminism, by pointing towards intersectional identities.
Through comprehensive experiments, researchers at Ashoka University were able to capture how group categorization affected attitudes, where lower ingroup-outgroup* differentiation produced the most positive attitudes. Yet, this was different when we looked at historically segregated group identities (North Indian/ South Indian), where regional identity significantly influenced how the perception of positive vs negative online posts affected outgroup attitudes. Emotions like empathy also mediated the relationship between message valence and intergroup attitudes.
This is one of the first social psychological investigations into CMC in the Indian context, and one of the few studies overall to look at mediated social media interactions, that is, via asynchronous posts and comments. The findings not only add to and diversify work on CMC and intergroup relations but also highlight how existing social identities, history, and political realities interact with words and messages to change social dynamics.
It is anticipated that this research will contribute to our limited understanding of technology and social life by aiding informed policy around cyber safety that leverages positive contact and reduces the adverse consequences of negative experiences which could fuel further conflict and violence.

Ashokapreneur Highlight: Abbas Ali Zaveri, Founder, Hypefly
This interview attempts to capture the entrepreneurial journey of Abbas (UG’23) and the trajectory of Hypefly
Manoj Kumar Reddy Dinne26 December, 2022 | 4m read
What is Hypefly? How did it start and what is the story behind it?
Well, it all started back when I was in 11th Grade, just another broke teenager who wanted to buy a pair of limited-edition premium sneakers. I faced 2 major problems with this purchase, one being the fact that a pair of such sneakers was way over a student’s budget and, the other factor being that I had absolutely no idea where to find these types of sneakers in India. This drove me to speak to a lot of people, and make new connections, all in an attempt to figure out how to purchase these sneakers in India. Soon, I was able to find a community of such sneakerheads who were willing to sell me a pair. When it came to the problem of my budget to fund this purchase, I had an idea. Why not find people with similar interests, facing the same problem, and solve it by supplying these pairs which I had managed to track down? This search for buying my first pair of sneakers led to the birth of a business idea. One by one I began selling these pairs to my friends over Instagram.
The beginning was tough. I would make one sale a week, or at max. two. However, as time passed, the sale picked up. I had generated enough capital to invest in my own inventory which allowed me to create an online store as an Instagram page to put these sneakers up for sale. That was when we initially launched our Instagram page – @hypefly.in. We had a successful start since we had great organic growth and the number of sales kept growing.
Eventually one and a half years after operating from Instagram, I decided it was time to take it to another level. We formally registered as a private limited company and began the journey to create a website. From the inception of the idea and accounting for every small detail ensuring it was perfect, it took us six months until we could launch the website www.hypefly.co.in. This is the story of our journey.
From a click on the website to order to doorstep delivery, could you run us down the seamless operations you do?
Our process is smooth and convenient for the customer and us too. On the customer’s end, once they make the purchase on the website, they receive an order confirmation along with an order number. On our end, as we receive this order, it is at once located in our warehouse and sent for a quality check. This is followed by packaging and branding. We double-box and wrap all our products so our customers receive their sneakers in perfect condition. Post packaging a shipping label is generated, after which the pair is shipped and the tracking details are mailed to the customer. The whole process takes about 24 hours until dispatch after which in 36-48 hours our customers receive their kicks right at their doorstep.
What is Hypefly’s USP?
Hypefly solved the three major problems when it comes to the purchase of hyped and limited sneakers. We guarantee 100% authenticity, providing a full refund for even the smallest flaws, we solve the pricing of the collection trade off providing a large collection of 450 pairs in 10 different sizes at highly competitive prices, further we make the whole process of shopping for such sneakers seamless with our simple to use UI/UX over on our website.
Bollywood stars like Ranveer Singh, Deepika Padukone etc. are Hypefly’s customers—how did that happen?
It all started one day when I got a call from celebrity stylist Shaleena Nathani, who was making an inquiry regarding sneakers for Deepika Padukone. Stunned by her words, I quickly rounded up some options at great prices and sent them over to her. Soon after I got a call that she had made her picks and they required it delivered to the film set. That day I was able to interact with her while she tried on the shoes, and she was no doubt in love with the pairs. Later that year Shaleena requested pairs for Shah Rukh Khan and Hardik Pandya too! Over time, word spread in the industry, and stylists would contact us to style celebrities. This gave me the opportunity to interact with many celebrities, and have the biggest stars like Ranveer Singh, Siddharth Malhotra, and KL Rahul wear Hypefly.
Can you tell us about any milestones/memorable moments for you at Hypefly?
The day we launched the website will forever be one of my favourite moments. The result of six months of hard work and planning was going to be decided. The moment the website went up we saw a rapid rise in the number of live viewers resulting in issues with payments, servers, etc. We had never anticipated such a great response. Gathering the web development team, we spent the whole night troubleshooting and ensuring the performance of the website goes as per our standards. Eventually, our stress came to an end, the website took off perfectly and the orders started growing exponentially. The moment it hit me that this project was a success is one which I can never forget. The whole process from brainstorming the website, and orchestrating and marketing our launch to the excessive stress finally paid off when it went live.
What is the next big thing Hypefly is planning to do?
Over the next few years, we plan to expand into other subsidiary products ranging from sneaker care to sneaker storage. Currently, we are in the works of launching our very own clothing brand, a sustainable and affordable streetwear label. Over the next few months, we expect development with this and hopefully will launch soon. Apart from that, we have a long-term goal of launching our very own sneaker experiential store in Mumbai, which hopefully we will achieve soon!
Describe Hypefly in 3 words?
Culture, Authenticity, & Fashion
The interview was conducted by Manoj Kumar Reddy Dinne (MLS’23), who TA’ed for the Startup Incubation Lab by Srikant Sastri in Monsoon Semester 2022 where Abbas was a course participant.,https://www.ashoka.edu.in/ashokapreneur-highlight-abbas-ali-zaveri-founder-hypefly/
Ashokapreneur Highlight: Amaan Andicot, Co-Founder, Finforall
This case blog captures the story of Finforall’s journey from inception to getting acquired and everything in between
The creation of the asset
After graduating from Shiv Nadar School, Gurgaon in 12th grade, Aayush decided to take a gap year to “take a break from academia”. In that period, he caught wind of a vicious cycle wherein, kids never really got comfortable with money and thus rarely sought to figure out how to earn more of it or allocate it intelligently, apart from the standard of getting a job and putting the money that’s left over into FDs and some mutual funds that their uncle recommends. Due to poor financial habits, many people are left with a far lower amount of money than they would have if they had practised fiscal discipline. A lack of money is not the ideal situation to be in and not talking about it makes the situation worse. Aayush resolved to break this money taboo.
He did so, by starting an Instagram page which went by the name of Finforall.
With what little savings he had, Aayush hired a graphic designer part-time and focused on brand building. He ran continuous experiments on social media pertaining to the content and found that brief and concise articles interwoven with clean, yet vibrant illustrations worked very well with audiences (who at the time were friends and their extended social circles). What worked for Finforall was that carousels (a new content format on Instagram at the time) gained a significant amount of traction and were seeing farther reach than just utilising pictures and slapping articles down in the caption (which was what Finshots – the only player in the market at the time was doing). He doubled down on this new form of content by using illustrations coupled with articles that could be read in no more than 3 minutes and pushing it to the designer to have it drawn out in creatives wherein, the content took centre stage. Within the first few months of going live, Finforall had crossed the 10k follower base mark. This follower count is important as per data from social blade spanning hundreds of pages, the founders realised that the algorithm Instagram uses to push out content to new audiences goes into overdrive once a page crosses 10,000 followers.
Getting to the 10k mark is arguably one of the hardest milestones to achieve on an Instagram page as growth primarily must either be: 1) inorganic (leveraging Instagram ads) which puts engagement at risk, or 2) via word of mouth which is extremely difficult to achieve.
Aayush found that Finforall was in a unique position. Given the surge of interest that took place during the pandemic for investing and the increased amount of screentime people put in towards social media, there was latent demand just waiting to be tapped and no player in the market was capitalizing on it. This first-mover advantage enabled Finforall to scale aggressively and that too, organically (i.e – with 0 ad spends). At the time, Finshots had total dominance on the newsletter segment; however, Instagram was a relatively underutilized platform on the topic of Finance. Thus, less competition and strong demand from consumers made Aayush plough on with Finforall, eventually rolling out podcasts that were available on Spotify, Apple Music and all major platforms. These podcasts hosted industry legends like Matt Dajer from Yes Theory (a prominent YouTube page), Tanmay Bhat from AIB & Nikhil Kamath, Co-Founder of Zerodha.
Eventually, Finforall scaled to 50,000 followers and Aayush had burned over Rs. 2,00,000 into the project without any sight of obtaining a return on the capital invested.
Entry of a co-founder
Finforall as a company started with a very specific chance interaction. While out on a family vacation to Rishikesh, Amaan happened to get acquainted with an HNI. Upon learning about Amaan’s interest in investing and his track record over the years, the strategies and rationale behind the investments made, the HNI offered to sign Amaan a cheque to kickstart a public market investment fund with a long-term investment horizon, if Amaan could provide a rationale behind the usage of the money. The catch: in the future or at any point in his career, if Amaan was to turn entrepreneurial and start a venture, the HNI would be issued equity as a sign of good faith. Secondly, in case of any capital losses, Amaan would be personally liable for paying him back his principal amount. The flip side to this was, that if Amaan were to consistently outperform the markets for a 5-year horizon, the HNI would up his stake in the fund and get other HNIs to invest with him. This was a deal of a lifetime for Amaan as it gave him exactly what he dreamt about…his own investment fund. This deal however came at a steep cost.
Pressed with this decision, Amaan reached out to Aayush, an old friend and a devil’s advocate. After hearing about the terms of the deal, Aayush simply advised “don’t do it, dude”. Instead, he came up with another proposal. He threw Amaan an offer to own half of Finforall as a Founder and to create a business model around it. Aayush was creative with his solutions to problems, while Amaan was an executor who’d bring ideas to life.
Equity Split
Aayush and Amaan didn’t want to needlessly inflate the value of the business especially when there is no revenue or profit to justify such a steep increase. While Amaan was adamant about getting in at the lowest possible valuation as Finforall was just one year old at that time, Aayush felt strongly that he had taken on a disproportionate amount of risk doing it alone full-time for an entire year, investing his savings and taking a gap year with no clear ROI. Finally, it was decided that Amaan would buy a 50% stake off of Aayush. This enabled the valuation to stay low enabling Amaan to get in on the ground floor, i.e – keeping the business valued at Rs. 4 lakhs while compensating Aayush for his risk-taking. Thus, they agreed on a 50-50 equity split.
Both founders had seen many businesses fail due to irreconcilable differences among the founders, which eventually permeated into other issues. So, both of them would regularly talk through why a certain course of action was better and if the other wasn’t convinced, they would drop the idea altogether. Such a style worked given a high degree of alignment among their values. They were striving to create a cash-compounding machine and one that was not only sustainable but profitable, to begin with.
Structuring out the Company: The Birth of a Business Model
The founders found out that they had a concentrated niche of:
- 24-35-year-olds
- A healthy mix of both genders
- People have either just started working or have limited work experience
- Educated audience with basic knowledge about personal finance
- Possession of savings that can be invested and used 1-2 Bank Accounts
The founders realised that the readers were their greatest asset. To be the customer acquisition channel for finance-based startups, Finforall started offering digital marketing services. It did so by running integrated posts for reputed fintech Brands and financial services companies. So:
- Finforall positioned itself at a premium price point given the high quality of audiences.
- The first ad campaign run was for CoinDCX.
Following a stringent KYC process Finforall only promoted brands which fit at least one of the two categories:
- Founders had used the product/service themselves and felt satisfied.
- The product/service would be of value to their readers.
This helped Finforall, retain the trust of their audiences. Simply put, they put their ear to the ground, studied vast amounts of data and tried to diagnose what problems the audiences faced and how those problems could be solved.
This eventually led to the need to expand the team. Finforall was operating at a very small scale and the founders had to get creative with the hiring process. Knowing that beaten-down stocks tend to trade for lower than even their cash value on the books, they adopted a similar strategy for hiring:
- Find meritorious prospects that have the academic calibre and domain experts but lack soft skills.
- These prospects got passed on for numerous prestigious internships or jobs.
- This in turn enabled Finforall to have high bargaining power with their hires and the hires accepted below industry standards for pay.
This allowed Finforall to expand aggressively while keeping its costs in check. Barring a token salary, all profits that were borne after paying off the entire team’s salaries were ploughed right back into the business, leading to huge profits.
Finforall leveraged the user feedback – there was a high demand for people to learn investing. There was a lack of solid offerings in the market. So Finforall went ahead and handcrafted a course for a batch size of 30 seats (later raised to 50). Rationale – quality came first above all else and only serious candidates were granted seats. The USP of the course was simple – the course provided meritorious members with a shot at working with a highly prestigious hedge fund based in India. Finforall was happy to discover the product market fit – receiving 250 applicants within the first 48 hours of opening up the course to their focus groups. The course was priced at Rs. 3,499 a seat. Courses having a zero marginal cost of replication allowed them to remain asset-light.
An Opportunity to Raise Investment
Due to the traction, Finforall enjoyed a YCombinator-backed startup that wanted to explore the possibility of investing in the company. The founders flew down to Mumbai, however, after preliminary discussions Aayush and Amaan decided against raising investment given that they didn’t need the capital at that stage and so this would be needlessly diluting the equity. The idea was to remain bootstrapped for as long as possible.
Competitive Pressures
Inspired by the traction received by Finforall, new players started entering the market. Due to increased competition, organic growth for Finforall began to stall.
This is when the founders turned to utilising data and tried to assess what kind of content could go viral. The strategy coupled with targeted inorganic expansion got the growth engine back into full gear.
During this period, barely anybody was advertising on social media. Ad spends were as low as Rs 0.5-0.75 per account. For context, when the advertising boom followed a few months later, ad spending jumped to figures as high as Rs. 2-5 per account reached. Inorganic forms of growth helped Finforall reach the 75k follower mark. This led to significant attention from multiple brands and deal flow began to resume.
In this time period, many foreign clients were opening up shops in India and Finforall became their favourite to advertise with given its audience composition.
Inflow from foreign clients = Need of reaching audiences with high net worths = Competition for limited ad space on Finforall = Pricing Power, given brand value.
Navigating the Acquisition
In December 2021, a foreign hedge fund managed to obtain an overseas direct investment licence from the RBI. This fund was making waves at that time featuring in Sucheta Dalal’s Moneylife, ET, and Financial Express (to name a few). This hedge fund was keen on running an integrated ad campaign on Finforall. The hedge fund turned out to be the dream client for Finforall. Firstly, it paid the full amount upfront which is rare when it comes to running campaigns. Secondly, a single integrated post that Finforall ran for them generated $23,000 worth of investments for the fund. Thus, they were keen on exploring the possibility of acquiring Finforall.
The hedge fund was happy to close the deal on the terms that the founders put forth and executed the transaction quickly. Amaan and Aayush knew the euphoria in the market wasn’t going to last forever and if they were to take their chips off the table, then that was the time. Their mentor of sorts offered to float the acquisition offer around to see if he could get them a better deal than what was on the table. The founders also consulted an industry veteran regarding the market behaviour and that confirmed their hypothesis.
The very next day, their contact returned with two buyers. One Jupiter – a neo-bank and the second NeoPay – an Indian e-commerce system and payments processor for teens. Finforall had 3 potential buyers at the table which gave the founders the ability to negotiate the best possible deal by staking one offer against the other.
Eventually, the hedge fund applied pressure on insisting on closing the deal within the following week. This forced the founders to negotiate more aggressively with the other potential buyers. In the end, they narrowed it down to 2 potential avenues:
Jupiter – same target groups, highly experienced management, ideal culture fit for Finforall. The valuation was at 21x Revenue which was better than the hedge fund deal. Additional Clauses: 3-year non-compete post-1-year binding employment contract to oversee the transition.
Hedge Fund – Faster closure of the deal, more tax efficient (transaction in cash), news articles on both founders regarding the acquisition, no binding clauses or non-compete.
The Jupiter deal was of larger ticket size, and was a better fit for Finforall but came with sharp consequences. The Hedge fund deal on the other hand gave the founders the freedom to do what they wanted as soon as the transaction was closed. This was ideal given the fact that they were attempting to perform a hostile majority stake takeover on a similarly sized competitor of Finforall due to fundamental differences between their stakeholders. What worked against the Hedge Fund deal was the pressure to decide quickly.
In addition to this, Amaan and Aayush had never been able to get onto a video call with the hedge fund buyers. On the other hand, Jupiter’s management was more than communicative. During the entire acquisition saga, the founders noticed that the Hedge Fund’s Chief Investment Officer was slated to come onto a prestigious conclave/summit that happens once a year and is run by an extremely reputed media house. Looking at the image of the CIO, they ran a backwards search only to find out that that’s not him, but rather a stock image of a “businessman” that’s been used in 14 different places including MensHealth!
The term sheet for both deals came in on the same day. They went ahead with Jupiter.
At the time of pitching, Finforall had a follower base of 132K, reached 1,032,118 accounts and garnered over 6,128,000 impressions over a 90-day period. The page had a baseline engagement rate of 3.48%.
Keywords:
- Traction = Follower Growth
- Engagement Rate = For social media pages, it is calculated as:
(Likes+Comments+Saves+Shares) / Total Follower Base
The higher the engagement rate of a page, the better the page is from a quality standpoint.
- Carousels = a slideshow format of putting together photos in the same Instagram post

Between Classes & Office Hours: A Candid Conversation with Prof. Mukesh Sud
On a cold winter morning as Prof. Sud takes a break to enjoy his fruits, we got a brief opportunity to have a candid conversation with him to get to know him better
Mukesh Sud is an Associate Professor at the Indian Institute of Management, Ahmedabad, and a Visiting Faculty at the Department of Entrepreneurship, Ashoka University.
We recently got a chance to have a chat with him about the various aspects of his life.
Here is what he had to say:
How did you begin teaching at Ashoka University?
It was really happenstance. I joined IIM Ahmedabad in 2015 after returning from the US. I would often come and spend weekends on campus with my daughter who was in the founding batch. On one such visit, I was invited to speak to the students about entrepreneurship. One thing led to another, I met the founders who saw a synergy between my experience at liberal arts universities in the US and the program here. I have now been offering at least one course every term for the past 6 years.
How different are students here from those you have at Ahmedabad?
Oh, very different. MBA students at IIMA are typically focused on a job. Many of them have student loans that they need to pay back and a job is the only way they can do that. Many will consider entrepreneurship maybe 5-10 years later. Others may become intrapreneurs that are entrepreneurs within the companies they work for. Alums tell us that having an entrepreneurial mindset is one of the necessary skills that we must teach our MBA students.
Are students here like the ones you taught in the US?
Yes, in some ways and different in others. Both here and in the US, liberal arts students enjoy trying out a number of courses before deciding what they would like to major in. At Ashoka, students are very concerned about their careers, and the jobs they will get after graduation. Students in the US, unless they have a loan, go with the flow and treat college as a time to enjoy themselves and be away from their parents. We used to joke that at Fairfield U, where I previously taught, the faculty, the administrators, and the Jesuit priests would all claim that students were drawn to the university due to what they offered. When students were polled about why they had joined the answer was a reality check for us all. It was Fairfield’s reputation as a party town and the nearby beach that was the main draw in attracting students.
Which do you enjoy more- teaching here at Ashoka or at IIMA?
Both give different types of satisfaction. At the Institute students are drawn to my elective after they have got jobs. They want to pick up skills like design thinking that will be needed in the corporate world. Here at Ashoka, students would like to cultivate an entrepreneurial mindset which they feel will help them in whatever they do whether in a job or in launching their own ventures.
What changes have you noticed in the students over the past 7 years?
A lot! The students are more focused and more competitive. I pull my daughter’s leg that she was fortunate to be in the founding batch. With the increased competitiveness she may not have been able to get admission today. She of course is quick to reply that the initial few batches laid the foundation to make Ashoka what it is today.
What is your area of research?
Broadly an entrepreneurial mindset. Lately, however, I have changed the kind of research I do. Rather than writing papers that get published in scholarly journals, I have written a book. Our research papers are only read by academics. There is so much hidden away in them that can help our students as they navigate their careers. Along with Priyank Narayan from the Centre, we have just published a book which describes six practices that will enable people to leapfrog to the future they want. The book, also called Leapfrog, has been published by Penguin.,https://www.ashoka.edu.in/between-classes-office-hours-a-candid-conversation-with-prof-mukesh-sud/
Between Classes & Office Hours: Experience of Teaching as a Visiting Faculty at Ashoka University
Sridhar is an investor and a prolific traveler. In this blog he describes his journey and his experience as a Visiting Faculty at Ashoka
Sridhar Sethuram26 December, 2022 | 6m read
I, for the past 3 decades, post-IIM Ahmedabad, have been engaged in co-creating businesses with entrepreneurs as an Operational Private Equity Investor and a Listed Stock Market investor with a PE Mindset. I have also been divinely blessed to have backpacked 120+ countries across the 7 continents and 25 of the 29 Indian states. I have also been an avid trekker and marathoner. I am also a part-time visiting Faculty at various B-Schools.
Since 2015, I have been teaching at various B-Schools, various versions of the course named Demystifying Investments – PE/VC (Private Equity/Venture Capital). The investment thesis is to inspire at least 5-10 % of the class to think differently and inject them with the “keeda” of being a maverick and hope that they would go out and positively impact society and send blessings to me when they succeed. It is a form of giving back to society in gratitude for all the privileges one has received in this lifetime. It was a blessing in disguise when Priyank Narayan at Ashoka University agreed to offer me a platform to pilot experimenting with the course at an undergrad level.
The course is based on the fundamental premise that the personal life and career of every individual is also one of an investor and entrepreneur. Students can apply the same investment principles when making decisions in professional life – including when they decide their career choices (where to invest the time capital of life) and entrepreneurship (everyone has to have an entrepreneurial mindset whether on salary or not). And their journey from being a start-up professional to one with experience and wisdom is similar to that of any business enterprise.
The course takes the participants on a journey through the lens, mindset and decision frameworks of an investor across:
- Life Stages: Across Angel, Seed, VC, PE, Pre-IPO and Listed markets with a PE mindset
- Asset Classes: Unlisted, Real Estate and Listed Stocks
- Sectors: Real Estate, FinTech, Social enterprises and Ecommerce
The course includes India-specific case studies and sharing of experiences of successful investors and entrepreneurs.
The course has the following vectors to achieve learning outcomes:
- Cases and pre-class group submissions
- In-class Case Discussion
- Fireside chat with guest speakers preferably linked to the case
- RolePlay of an Investment Committee where Students present the investment thesis for sectors/ companies they have chosen
The key highlights of my teaching experience here at Ashoka are as follows:
- I was amazed that the participants could hold attention for 3+ hours. This proves my hypothesis that this generation does NOT display Attention Deficit Syndrome when there is value on the table delivered with fun and transparency. My last class ( an extra one and that too at student request on a Sunday) lasted 4 hours 15 mins with students joining me at lunch for another hour.
- The course includes fireside chats, which are designed to be conducted by a selected panel of 2-3 students with no involvement of the instructor. I was super impressed with the quality of the questions in the class and the conduct of the session. Almost every speaker had a googly question asked which made them pause and think.
- The interactions with the students outside class have been enrichening. I was impressed with the hunger to learn and make a difference in Life in most of the course participants.
- Last but not the least, as the course progressed, there was a marked improvement in the intellectual rigour and application of the pre-class case submissions. Some of the final submissions were much better than those from B School students or even better than what I would have delivered as an MBA student😊.
Teaching at Ashoka has been a multi-bagger investment (esp. considering I travel 12 hours to and fro Mumbai to teach a class of 240 mins and would be returning to take more courses across the coming semesters. You learn so much from the class and have such fun in the class discussions.
Hats off to the founders and leadership at Ashoka to have built such a great institution in such a short time. I would highly recommend becoming visiting faculty at Ashoka to other professionals. The adrenaline rush from being granted the opportunity to sculpt such young curated minds and souls, and make a difference in their life is priceless.
Best wishes to the Ashoka team. I am sure the students will have a phenomenal impact on the future trajectory of not only India but the world.

Between Classes & Office Hours: Web3 & the Creator Economy
Jaspreet Bindra is a thought-leader on digital transformation and digital technologies. During one of his trips from Cambridge to Ashoka, he penned down his insights on the Creator Economy in the Web3
Jaspreet Bindra19 December, 2022 | 6m read
As you browsed the World Wide Web, you would have certainly encountered the infamous 404 error, signifying that a web page is ‘not found’. What you have not seen is a similar code 402, which actually stands for ‘payment required’. This was the piece that Tim Berners-Lee and his team left unfinished when they were fashioning the World Wide Web many decades back. The original intention was that every visitor had to pay something to view a web page, but the schema was never built, and even now, therefore, there is no standardised encoded way to send or receive money online.
The fact that user-pays was never the business model of the Web. Initially, most of it was free. Then, Yahoo and others scaled up publishing and advertising as the business model, which Google and Facebook took to another level. Besides advertiser-pays, another business model started taking shape – that of commerce, which Amazon started dominating. Off late, the tech world has begun revisiting the payments and commerce business model again. The reason is very simple – all of the advertising is $470bn a year, and e-commerce is ten times bigger at $5tn a year, albeit with thinner margins. E-commerce makes up approximately 18 per cent of the overall retail market already and is growing fast. Companies like Square, Paypal and UPI in India are building the online payments infrastructure to address the original 402 error. But the company dominating it and making it as simple as Berners-Lee and his team perhaps envisaged is the San Francisco-head-quartered Stripe. Stripe burst into prominence with its one-time valuation of $95bn, making it the most valuable private company ever. With its ambitious mission statement to ‘increase the GDP of the Internet’, it heralds a far more dramatic shift: the business model of the World Wide Web is shifting – from advertising to payments and subscriptions. The signs have been there for a while. The tech lash against rampant data monetization and the impact on privacy is the most prominent. Facebook has added shopping tabs on Instagram, it has started payments on WhatsApp in India and Brazil, and it has even debuted its own cryptocurrency. Tiktok is treading into e-commerce with a partnership with Shopify, and now, Elon Musk is making Twitter a subscription model too with the $8 Twitter Blue!
This new decentralised monetization model is giving rise to what is called Web3. A lot has been written about Web3, and it has become an elastic term being used for anything: pure crypto plays used it to make them sound more respectable, minting NFTs of bored mammals are seen to be Web3 ideas, so is buying virtual land or doing fashion shows in the ‘metaverse’. Yes, Web3 is all of this, but it is much more. Web 1.0 was about reading static content pages on MSN, Yahoo or AOL, and started in the 1990s. Web 2.0 burst forth in 2005 with Facebook, Twitter, YouTube and the like and is about people creating and posting their own content, going beyond just passively reading it. Web3 (for some reason using 3.0 is considered unfashionable) goes beyond where you not only actively participate, but also own and build pieces of it through ownership tokens and blockchain technologies, thus distributing ownership away from the highly centralised ownership of Web 2.0. So, if Web 1.0 was about Read, Web 2.0 is Read and Write, Web3 would be about Read, Write and Own.
But nothing signifies this titanic shift to Web3 and the new monetization model as the rapid rise of what is being called the ‘creator or passion economy’. This concept of enabling people with an online following to make money from sales was initially popularised in China. Then came Twitch which did this in gaming, Patreon which enabled crowdfunding for artists, and then Substack which helps writers monetize their blogs and columns. The original creator economy pioneer was perhaps YouTube, with kids in the US three times more likely to want to become YouTubers than astronauts!
The term was introduced in a seminal blog post ‘The Passion Economy and the Future of Work’ by Li Jin of Andreesen Horowitz, where she talked about how this trend will shift the current mass standardisation to ‘monetizing individuality’, where we “view individuality as a feature, not a bug.” The VC firm SignalFire says that this new ‘economy’ has more than 50mn creators, of which two million are making more than $100000 a year! Most of them are writers, artists, singers, and people with a passion in the arts, rather than the techies you would expect. The pandemic turbo-charged this economy – Etsy, an original creator economy company where individuals sell artisanal objects, had $346mn of mask sales! It was in 2006, that Chris Anderson predicted this trend in his book The Long Tail. His thesis was that products in low demand can collectively make up the market share of blockbuster rivals. He prophesied, “When the tools of production are available to everyone, everyone becomes a producer.” 15 years later, his wish that we move away from “suffering the tyranny of lowest-common-denominator fare” is coming to fruition.
Small live streams on Twitch outcompete with the Oscars and Grammys. OnlyFans users pay for niche and private conversations and viewings of individuals, rather than watch blockbusters. YouTube has 30mn channels, with those earning more than $10000 growing at 40%. The top 10 authors on Substack collectively make over $15M per year. The top content creator on Podia, a platform for video courses, makes more than $100,000 a month. Even the mighty Amazon, a standardised marketplace, is wary of the individual-driven Shopify. NFTs or Non-Fungible Tokens, an integral part of the Web3 economy have emerged to help digital artists monetize their offerings is one more offshoot of the creator economy. Then there is the Metaverse. While it is still early days and Meta and others are under pressure to build it into a monetizable model, it offers an unprecedented opportunity for creators to monetize their offerings. This Economy is rising in India too, with startups like GoSocial creating platforms and tools to help artists monetize their wares. The Long Tail is getting longer and more rewarding. “In the future, everyone will be world-famous for 15 minutes”, said Andy Warhol in a 1968 exhibition of his work at the Moderna Museet in Stockholm. What he did not foretell was that everyone’s fame would be experienced concurrently and monetized so well.

Between Classes & Office Hours: Business Communication and Negotiation: Constructing, Deconstructing and Reconstructing Paradigms of Success
Prof. Asha Kaul is a veteran professor and a prolific author in the Communications area. While she already teaches Business Communication and Negotiation here at Ashoka, she wishes to demystify the subject for the wider ecosystem through this piece
Asha Kaul19 December, 2022 | 6m read
Communication- formal and organizational – can be tough. You may have experienced it. In case not, let us imagine…The stage is set and you need to interact, engage and communicate for that elusive win. What do you do? How do you prepare? Do the following questions prop up in your mind – Where do I begin? What do I say? Will I be able to create the desired impact? Sometimes you have an answer to these questions and communication is a huge success but on other occasions, the outcome is not favourable.
Where did you go wrong? What did you say what should not have been said? What did you not say what was expected to have been said? You may reflect and analyse, try to change your communication and adopt an amicable stand if you have the time. But the moment has passed and there is a negative tick placed beside your name.
In the course on Business Communication and Negotiation, we understand varied situations, and look for tactics and strategies to counter negativity and imbue positivity. Through the sessions, we constantly construct, deconstruct and reconstruct communication in an attempt of redefining success paradigms.
Construction
This requires effort. Understanding the situation and the involved stakeholders(the audience), the interplay between the situation and the stakeholders, and the relationship shared by all concerned stakeholders is just the beginning point for constructing the dialogue. Comprehending existing processes of communication with a peep into our own barriers to communication is just the beginning point. Cognizing our strengths, and chasing and curating the areas of improvement provides each one of us a base to create our own edifice for communication. For some it is a strengthening of the existing processes, for others, it is an understanding of the outside world, the expectations and their own contributions in reaching the ‘win’ situation.
Clips featuring corporate leaders add to the fury of the discussion. Can ideas and emotions be reflected through verbal and non-verbal communication? If yes, what are the signs and signals to be cognized? How do all these signs and signals converge to yield single or multiple messages? The process more than the outcome becomes the central point of discussion.
By now, understanding the process of construction is over… what now?
Deconstruction
Take a long pause and a deep breath … have you considered the logic of the recipient? What appeals and what does not? Is the framing right, and the tone appropriate? How do you logically plug the audience requirements in the edifice you have created? Logic then becomes the pivot for analysis of such problem situations. In both, oral as well as written communication, content is broken up into smaller chunks for in-depth analysis and evaluation.
Now begins the more tedious part of understanding the audience, their expectations and subsequent recalibration. Listening with an objective to understanding the perspective of the audience, presenting with a focus on the stakeholders, negotiating to cooperate more than compete, building narratives to appeal to the sensibilities, persuading and influencing to change behaviour for compliance, facilitates the deconstruction of existing communication processes and procedures.
The scattered bits and pieces of the deconstructed processes now require to be assembled. Should the process be phased or simultaneous? What will emerge as the new picture?
Reconstruction
Simultaneous with deconstruction begins the process of reconstruction. All introspect and gather a list of unwanted pieces of baggage in the knapsack we have been carrying over the years. Some more introspection is required at this point. What should you throw out and what should you retain? It is a personal choice based on the nature of the desired reconstruction. Panel discussions with experts in the area of communication and entrepreneurship act as a beacon of light. Understanding the challenges faced by these experts, their failures and the success matrix facilitates in the creation of a career compass which guides us in the right direction.
An important part of the reconstruction phase is the creation of a signature voice, an understanding of the je ne sais quoi (don’t know what). Initially, it may be difficult for us to identify the unique selling proposition (USP) that each one of us possesses. Some introspection, some reflection and we begin inching closer to the identification of ourselves, discovering our signature voice. Communication, appearance and body language have all been discussed, but the gravitas is now discovered and matched with the leadership style that each one of us possesses but has so far not verbalized.
Though the course comes to a logical end, the process for the students does not! It is just the beginning of a long and arduous journey. Traversing the path with ease or difficulty is a must. Interestingly, the destination at the end of this journey is the same for all – success. All that is now needed is a proactive step and a long stretch to clasp that definitive handle-defined success.

Biosciences in the Century of Complexity
Prof. Anurag Agrawal, Dean, Biosciences and Health Research, Trivedi School of Biosciences, illuminates upon his vision for the School
Anurag Agrawal31 August, 2023 | 4m read
At the turn of the century, Stephen Hawking said, “I think the next century will be the century of complexity”. Indeed, the elegant simplicity of the 20th century, with Einsteinian physics or uncovering the double helix code of life, has yielded way to a messier science where we focus on finding order within highly complex, interconnected systems. One of the major transformations has been in Biology. From sensing changes in geo-planetary ecosystems to capturing health trajectories of individuals and societies, there is a new interdisciplinary push that makes it likely that this will be the century of biology. The Trivedi School of Biosciences (TSB) recognises this need to seamlessly bring biosciences, advanced computing, other natural sciences, social sciences, and innovation together into one ecosystem of advancement.
TSB contains the Department of Biology and associated centres for enabling education and research in biosciences. Threads of data science and interdisciplinarity are woven into the fabric of TSB by design. While still a young department, the faculty has diverse expertise and backgrounds ranging from ecology to medicine. A state-of-the-art new building to house TSB with world-class ambience and facilities is nearing completion. Critical partnerships are in place. The need of the hour is to define and nucleate complementary centres, which may one day grow into institutions and multi-investigator labs that may develop into centres. Towards this, the Centre for Health Analytics Research and Trends (CHART) and the Koita Centre for Digital Health at Ashoka (KCDH-A) have already taken shape between TSB and the Department of Computer Science.
Recognising the importance of diverse data types spanning people, animals, and environment in the conceptualisation of One Health, CHART aims to collect, curate, integrate, analyse, and disseminate such data while also recognising that solutions to most large-scale problems, such as a pandemic, require an understanding of the surrounding socio-economic-political frameworks. Thus, it is a privilege that CHART has come to exist alongside ongoing Ashokan initiatives like the Center for Economic Data (CEDA) and the Centre for Social and Behaviour Change (CSBC).
Simultaneously, the convergence of healthcare, genomics, information technology, and artificial intelligence revolutions have also radically changed how health will be imagined and delivered for individuals and communities. KCDH-A aspires to develop fresh perspectives and nurture a new generation of Digital Health thinkers, innovators, and implementers through a balanced emphasis on education and research.
CHART and KCDH-A are just the beginning. Deeper insights into cancer biology and human genetics along with advanced studies of glycans and metabolic programming, would help form other nucleation points. While these are envisioned as team research topics, individual-driven deep thinking and research remain critical. Despite increasing focus on translational research by funding agencies, the fact remains that one must understand before one can translate.
The larger vision of TSB is to enable researchers to ask significant questions that cut horizontally across the verticals represented by the centres. For example, it is likely that complex sugars in foods, when metabolised by gut bacteria, lead to the release of metabolites and glycan products that alter immune programming. It is also well known that poor nutrition or infections can reprogram immunity, leading to altered health risks, including cancer. So far, we have a minimal understanding of these topics, whether at the fundamental level of mechanisms or the higher level of applications. More importantly, these intersections extend well beyond classic experimental biology. Computational structural simulations, synthetic biology, and systems immunology are all junctional fields of great promise. With a finite number of faculty, TSB is not expected to solve the unsolved suddenly. Instead, it is expected to champion a different and unfettered way of working across disciplines to collaboratively advance the field, serving as a model for change. That is the Ashokan vision.

#Bookmarked: Leapfrogging your way to success
‘Leapfrog: Six Practices to Thrive at Work’ by Mukesh Sud and Priyank Narayan, published by Penguin India, lays down six evidence-based insights to help readers advance their careers at an incredible pace
Saman Waheed28 November, 2022 | 4m read
Priyank Narayan is the Head of the Department of Entrepreneurship and the Director of the InfoEdge Centre for Entrepreneurship at Ashoka University. Mukesh Sud is an Associate Professor at the Indian Institute of Management, Ahmedabad, and a Visiting Faculty at the Department of Entrepreneurship, Ashoka University.
Their book, “Leapfrog” blends stories and anecdotes which are supported by extensive research to suggest six ways to flourish at work. Utilising their extensive experience of teaching and mentoring students the authors have developed a Personal Journey Map (PJM). This will help readers implement the six practices by capturing their current repertoire, scanning the landscape ahead, and curating a path to a career they desire.
We spoke to the authors about their experiences that led to the creation of this book. Here is what they had to say.
What were some of the incidents/people who helped lay the foundation of this book?
The ideas in this book are from our students. We have dedicated the book to them. We learn from them every day. Our students have shared their experiences on what works and has not worked for them at their workplace. We also had alumni, recruiters, and parents who shared their observations. The book is an amalgamation of everything we have experienced inside and outside the classroom since we started teaching.
In addition to that, we have extensively studied these practices to find out what researchers have discovered about them. Each story, practice, and pillar in the book has been validated. It may start with an anecdote but is supported by literature—we have around 30 pages of citations.
What were some of your key learnings while you were working on this book?
We kept iterating on the practices and the process to ensure that students not only succeed but can thrive in the workplace. We realized that the key to writing a book is to keep the reader engaged by giving them something that is doable and showing them how others have used it. We were able to learn this in the process of writing this book.
One of the practices we discuss in this book is curation. We had to live this practice by curating what we put together in this book. It has also helped us in our teaching as we now have a lot more focus on what we want our students to imbibe and develop.
We pushed each other so that we could validate a number of our intuitions with published research. We had to read extensively, speak to a lot of people and then build that into our book. It has been a strenuous but rewarding journey over three years.
Was this book initially conceptualized as a collaboration between the both of you?
Mukesh has been teaching at Ashoka University for the last seven years. We have been good friends for a long time. The acknowledgement section in the book has the story of how we met and got involved as a part of a collaboration between two premier institutions, IIM Ahmedabad and Ashoka University.
This book is an outcome of what good institutions with individuals who have the right intentions can create when they come together. As co-authors, we had to agree conceptually on the values we wanted to write about. So, the collaboration between us grew over time and we were then able to intellectually challenge each other.
I think we complemented each other very well. Mukesh had a strong MBA and research focus. I came from an undergraduate liberal arts teaching environment. where I had a lot of very practical anecdotes of students that I had taught. So, we were able to bring our forces together to create a good balance of theory and practice.
This model of collaboration is something that other educational institutions should look at. We often look at research and writing as being very inward-focused. If other institutions can be inspired to find partners to create and document knowledge, great collaborations can take place.
Who, in your opinion, should read this book?
The book is meant for everybody who cares about doing well at work—in their career and their life. Examples in the book are simple and apply to everybody. Whether the readers want to be efficient in managing their home, office, or life, they will find some story in the book that will resonate with them.
A lot of parents have reached out to us saying that they love some of the stories and are reading them to their children. There is enough for everybody to read and imbibe.
The book does not have to be read in one go. It has been divided into sections and each one offers a unique lesson in itself. It is ultimately what one wants to make out of it.
The interesting part of the book is that it also provides the readers with a Personal Journey Map (PJM), a framework that helps the readers plan and put into practice whatever they have learned from the book.
Leapfrog is not just a book to read, it is also a thinking and doing book. People should imbibe these practices and their pillars as a habit while they move forward.
What is the one piece of advice you would like to give to the readers if they want to thrive at work or in their life?
One very important element of doing well at work is having a well-defined goal. Many of us are hungry for success without knowing what success means for us. The goal might change and evolve over time but we need to pursue it. Only then can we find a path to get there.
We always encourage our students to think about what would make them happy. That in itself is a difficult question to answer, not just for students, but even for mid-career and senior professionals. However, people need to push themselves, otherwise, it becomes a classic story of ‘I am happy to be on a path without knowing the direction in which it is going.’
The first chapter in the book is about developing grit. Grit in one line is defined as passion and perseverance which can sustain over time. We can do anything we want in life if we can demonstrate grit because ultimately there is no shortcut to hard work.
Is there anything else apart from this, that you would like the readers to know before they jump into this book?
The world today expects everybody to do well, and that too at a young age. That early success is glamorized. This is one of the myths we want to challenge through this book, where we say that one can do well at any age. We talk about people who take time to get successful, and that is perfectly fine. Some people have to deal with a lot of constraints before they become successful, and that is fine as well.
We also have a website for the book for readers who want to engage with and explore the ideas beyond the book.
We would love to hear from readers about what they think and how they have been able to apply the learnings in their life.

Breaking the Mold: How Liberal Arts Can Open Up Infinite Avenues
As Stuti Ravikumar joins Unilever’s Future Leaders Programme, she reminisces about her time at the Young India Fellowship and recounts its profound impact on her life
Stuti Ravikumar’s journey epitomizes the spirit of multidisciplinarity and how a holistic, liberal arts education can open up infinite new ways of thinking and innumerable opportunities. Originating from Mysore, Stuti had spent most of her life there pursuing her education. An academically bright student in school, she was a jack of all trades as she signed up for several extracurricular activities. Stuti was always somewhat dissatisfied with the education system because it did not give her the freedom to study multiple subjects and disciplines. As she went on to pursue biotechnological engineering in Mysore, the minimal freedom she got when it came to choosing her electives was even more upsetting. Post-graduation, Stuti went on to intern at the reputed Merck Life Labs in Bangalore and started to build a niche for herself in the immunobiological space.
Alongside pursuing her engineering degree, Stuti freelanced for a newspaper in Mysore and worked for an NGO. During her time in college, she found herself fascinated by the world of fitness and nutrition and ventured deeper into that domain as well. Despite making strides in her professional and personal life, Stuti’s hunger for knowledge and multidisciplinary learning remained unsatiated. “I found out about the Young India Fellowship on a friend’s Instagram. I spent hours scrolling through their social media page and website because I found myself completely enthralled by the programme. Coming from a relatively small town, I did not know that something like a liberal arts education existed. It was as if the fellowship with its vast number of subjects and its diverse cohort was tailor-made for me,” said Stuti.
“While I did enjoy studying biotechnology and engineering, quant-heavy subjects were not really my strength. I was interested but I was not particularly inspired. That changed momentously when I came to Ashoka University for the Fellowship. The classes were designed in a way that sparked curiosity,” Stuti explained. When asked about what course was her favourite, she told us that it was undoubtedly Professor Debayan’s The New Geography of the Information Age. The course focused on the socio-technical problems caused by humanity blindly stumbling its way into the Information Age. “Professor Debayan would just throw random trivia at you and it would be your job to go back and study more about it. I cannot remember the number of wormholes I have gone down in based on what I learned in the class,” recalled Stuti. Young India Fellowship’s liberal arts pedagogy pushes students to explore the multiplicity of disciplines in an effort to shape them into well-rounded individuals with a holistic understanding of the world. Other courses that left a profound impact on Stuti were Shakespeare and the World offered by Professor Jonathan Gill Harris and Professor Madhavi Menon and Economic and Public Policy offered by A.K. Shiva Kumar.
The Experiential Learning Module (ELM) forms a core component of the YIF curriculum where the Fellows work in groups on real-world projects from diverse sectors in collaboration with partner organisations. For their ELM Stuti and her team worked with a biotech company and handled the post-production process (regulation, marketing, strategy, etc) of their new product—the UTI detection kit. “I loved my team because not only was it composed of passionate individuals who chose the project and each other but also because my peers came from such diverse backgrounds: one was a computer science engineer, one was a literature major and the other was an economist”, said Stuti. Over the last ten years of the YIF, projects have spanned diverse domains and sectors, including government and policy, entrepreneurship, social development, education, art and heritage, media and communications, and research among others.
Freshly out of the Fellowship, Stuti has been selected for the prestigious Unilever’s Future Leaders Programme (UFLP). An accelerated development programme designed to prepare future leaders for business roles, it gives graduates the opportunity to learn all about Unilever’s 400 diverse brands, business and sustainability efforts. Over a span of 12 months, Stuti will be placed in different roles across India to get experience in different sectors. “The Young India Fellowship quite literally prepared me for this. In a professional setting, you cannot just be like ‘Oh I don’t know this so I won’t do this’. That kind of attitude does not work in leadership positions. UFLP is sort of like an extended liberal arts education but in the business world” said Stuti. She asserts that liberal arts education has given her the required confidence to work across different roles and disciplines in an efficient and informed manner. “Coming from an engineering background, I never thought that I could ace a filmmaking course at YIF – but I did! This taught me so much about my own self and how if I put my heart and soul into something, there is no way I will not be able to achieve it”, she proudly exclaimed.
As Stuti looks back on her year-long journey, she says that the most important thing she is taking back is the newfound community that YIF has given her. “When driven individuals from across professional domains and geographical locations come together in one place—it is a powerhouse! Unlike my time at engineering school, the only homogenized experience that existed here was the sense of ‘family’ we felt towards each other. I know that wherever I go, I would be able to contact a YIF and they will welcome me with open arms.”

Entrepreneurship @ Ashoka in 2022
Prof. Priyank Narayan recounts all the significant entrepreneurial milestones of Ashoka University in 2022
Priyank Narayan30 December, 2022 | 4m read
“There are decades where nothing happens;
and there are weeks where decades happen”
~ Lenin
Our times have come to justify what Lenin said many decades ago. When we stepped into 2022, there was still fear and caution about the pandemic lingering around. We continued living our professional lives through the boxes on our screens for almost the entirety of the first quarter.
This was not much difficult for any as the inertia of WFH had already kicked in, the challenge was to break it, shun our pyjamas, and don a mask in a physical setting. There were students and colleagues who had started their journey with us virtually. It was an exciting period post the mid-sem break in March to finally meet them and get back into our work space and classrooms after two springs.
We had kickstarted the Spring Semester in January with a major uptick in the number of Entrepreneurship courses being offered. We were fortunate to have some of the pioneers and thought leaders in their respective fields teaching our students. From Pramod Bhasin, the Founder of Genpact doing a Leadership course to Raman Roy, a leader in the Indian BPO Industry and a prolific investor doing a course on How to Start a Startup. Then we had courses on the themes of digital transformation, real estate, finance, and investing added to our course catalogue. The trend of the Entrepreneurship course offerings going north continued for the Monsoon Semester in September with some amazing courses being offered in the areas of Leadership, Strategy, Finance, Digital Transformation, Management and Entrepreneurship. The number of students being engaged by us makes Entrepreneurship the biggest minor on campus. Our courses even attracted staff and alums who sit through them. I am particularly proud of a first-year student who spent her Monday evening voluntarily attending Aditya Ghosh’s In Pursuit of Service Excellence course. An alumnus travelled all the way from Gurgaon to attend the same class. It is these acts of dedication and determination that keep us going, and act as an assurance that we are on the right track.
As always, our courses had learning components even beyond the classroom through late-night Dhaba conversations with the faculty and guest speakers, field trips, and real-life immersive assignments where the students had the opportunity to gain hands-on experience through directly working with organizations, running live social media marketing campaigns, conducting sales research on the field, and even minting NFTs. A highlight of this year was the Dinner with Founders where our students could interact with Ashoka University founders like Ashish Dhawan, Pramath Raj Sinha, and Aditya Ghosh interact with students in an informal setting, singing along with them while strumming the guitar.
Another gratifying moment this year for us has been to see so many of our Entrepreneurship students acknowledging that their experiences with us have immensely contributed to their success during the Placement Season.
We continued empowering and supporting student-led initiatives on campus through various clubs like the Entrepreneurship Club and the Business Club, better known on the campus as E-Club and B-Club, besides assisting the Ashoka Investment and Consulting Clubs. They have surely been able to enhance the level of engagement on campus through their various intra as well as inter-institution events.
Supporting the startup founders and the startup ecosystem is of prime importance to us. The Startup Incubation Lab and the Entrepreneur-in-Residence programs witnessed Ashokapreneurs (student and alum startup founders) being systematically supported by mentors like Srikant Sastri, the President of TiE Delhi-NCR. We also participated in initiatives to strengthen the startup support ecosystems locally as well as globally.
Collaboration is a cornerstone of Entrepreneurship, and we were able to contribute to some interesting initiatives like the Panchkula Urban Dialogues with the Government of Haryana and the Registrar’s Office, Inclusion Through Innovation: Designing Barrier-free Environments with the OLS, and an L&D initiative for the staff and a fun staff after hours with the HR.
As Entrepreneurship at Ashoka progressed in leaps and bounds, there was a personal high for me in 2022. My book, ‘Leapfrog: Six Practices to Thrive at Work‘ co-authored with Prof. Mukesh Sud was published by Penguin India. It lays down six evidence-based insights to help readers advance their careers at an incredible pace.
In 2023, as we look to reinforce our various offerings including our courses, we would strive to promote and practice Human Centered Entrepreneurship and live the Ashoka Sutra values. We definitely want the weeks of 2023 to become fruitful, and help us set even higher benchmarks for ourselves. May 2023 in the pages of Ashoka’s history be a period where a ‘decade’ happened.

Ashoka University hosted the inaugural Rakesh Jhunjhunwala Memorial Lecture in Mumbai on Wednesday, August 2. The keynote address was delivered by Mr Uday Kotak, Managing Director and CEO of Kotak Mahindra Bank. The event was attended by over 280 people from the business and finance world.
In his address, Mr Kotak listed out 10 commandments for the country as India approaches its 100th year of independence. The points included focus on sustainability, building world-class educational institutions, strengthening the judiciary, building a robust CSR environment, encouraging efforts to make the Indian Rupee a global reserve currency, building a strong military power, achieving a current account surplus, democratisation of technology, enhancing soft power and making India an attractive destination for global citizens.
“Rakesh was great company and a man of very bold thinking. Very often, for a long time in his career, he was underestimated in terms of his insights into analysis and stocks. People in the early stages thought this is one more player in the market without realising the deep analysis and insights which were truly unique,” said Mr Kotak.
The naming of the Rakesh Jhunjhunwala School of Economics and Finance took place earlier this year to honour one of Ashoka’s key architects.
During the naming of the School, Rekha Jhunjhunwala, wife of Late Rakesh Jhunjhunwala said, “My husband’s dream was to build a world-class university in India for which he supported Ashoka University from its inception. It is a proud moment for me to see this dream being fulfilled and realised through the naming of the top Economics School in India as the Rakesh Jhunjhunwala School of Economics and Finance. There is no better way to celebrate his legacy.”
“We are very grateful to Rakesh bhai and his family for his contribution and support, and of course, for his evangelism. We wanted to pay a tribute to him not just through the naming of the school but also through an intimate portrayal of the man himself – the investor, the philanthropist and who, above all, held an unwavering belief in India and cared passionately for the country,” said Pramath Raj Sinha, Chairperson, Board of Trustees, Ashoka University.
The Economics faculty at Ashoka has conducted research on a wide range of subjects in Economics, including Game Theory, Development Economics, Behavioural Economics, Econometrics, Applied Microeconomics, amongst others. The Economics department has been ranked first in research excellence in India, by Research Papers in Economics (RePEc) – the world’s largest collection of scholarly information for Economics and related disciplines.
“The idea of a Liberal Arts education is not just concentrated on giving students the basic skills to cope with life in whatever fields they go to, but also encourage a very broad-based education in all the branches of Social Science, Humanities and the Quantitative Sciences. Almost a third of the students at Ashoka choose subjects that are related to Economics and Finance. And this is why the Rakesh Jhunjhunwala School of Economics and Finance is so important to Ashoka University,” said Somak Raychaudhury, Vice-Chancellor, Ashoka University.,https://www.ashoka.edu.in/inaugural-rakesh-jhunjhunwala-memorial-lecture-held-in-mumbai/
India’s Leap into Space: Aditya-L1 Mission Unveiling New Horizons
"By becoming the third space agency ever to reach L1, ISRO will cement its position as one of the leaders in the global space race,” says Professor Somak Raychaudhury, Vice Chancellor, Ashoka University
“Coming closely on the heels of the success of Chandrayaan-3, the launch of the Aditya-L1 mission is a display of serious intent by ISRO to demonstrate India’s prowess in space flight, engineering and research. For the first time, India will have an indigenously built space-based solar observatory, launched to reach a parking space that is 1.5 million kilometres away from our planet. This is one of the most complex missions undertaken by the Indian establishment, requiring highly intricate manoeuvres to correctly place the spacecraft into a halo orbit at the Lagrangian Point 1 (L1) between the Earth and Sun, taking advantage of the competing gravitational pulls of the two bodies. The mission will simultaneously study the relation between events on the Sun’s surface and the corresponding changes in the Sun’s corona, seeking to understand why the corona is more than a million degrees hot. It will also study the ejection of highly energetic charged particles from the Sun and their effect on planets, in real-time, in order to build an early-warning system for solar storms that can cause serious damage to Earth- bound satellites, our communication systems and electrical grids. It will also help us understand how the ultraviolet radiation from the Sun impacts our climate. By becoming the third ever space agency to reach L1, ISRO will cement its position as one of the leaders in the global space race.”

Inspiring Possibilities and Empowering Voices
The Spirit of YIF award has been bestowed upon Anil Bahariya and Dharani Dhavamani whose journey at the YIF is one of unwavering commitment to challenging norms and fostering inclusivity within the YIF community
The ‘Spirit of YIF’ Award celebrates Fellows who have gone above and beyond the call of duty, demonstrating creativity, energy, and an unwavering commitment to improving the programme. This year the award was bestowed upon Anil Bahariya and Dharani Dhavamani, whose outstanding leadership and inclusive nature have left an indelible mark on the YIF community.
Anil’s peers passionately expressed their admiration for his transformative contributions. His dedication to sparking conversations and challenging the status quo had a profound impact on the YIF community. Through his thought-provoking actions and inspiring initiatives, Anil created the space for important conversations and impacted the fellowship in more ways than one. Anil’s initiative, the Social Justice Forum, provided a platform to address critical issues that were previously overlooked.
Anil in his speech acknowledged the unexpected path that led him to the YIF Fellowship. Grateful for the opportunity, he reflected on the beauty and tragedy he encountered during his time in the programme. He passionately advocated for doing away with one-dimensional thinking and recognizing that true inclusivity required challenging societal biases.
Dharani Dhavamani’s journey at YIF has been nothing short of remarkable. Her peers describe her as someone deeply dedicated to every facet of the program, be it academics or extracurricular activities. As a member of the Academic Committee, Dharani skillfully balanced the needs of her cohort with administrative constraints, ensuring a seamless experience for all. Her unique talent for bringing people together has fostered an inclusive environment where diverse voices are not only heard but valued—a testament to her remarkable ability to connect with others.
In her speech, Dharani expressed her gratitude to her fellow Fellows for this priceless honour. She acknowledged how the YIF Fellowship represents a diverse mix of experts, amateurs, rule-breakers, path-makers, and individuals from all walks of life. Despite their differences, this collective strives for a common purpose—a purpose that unites them and drives them to create a meaningful impact. Dharani highlighted the strength of unity and the power of a group of people who not only know how to get things done but are also passionate about making a difference.
As the YIF community continues its journey of growth and transformation, their inspiring journey serves as a reminder of the power of individual actions in shaping a more inclusive and equitable future. They have exemplified the core values of the Young India Fellowship and shown to us that unity, passion, and a collective drive for positive change can create a profound impact.,https://www.ashoka.edu.in/inspiring-possibilities-and-empowering-voices/

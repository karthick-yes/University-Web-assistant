0,"Chemistry Handbook    GUIDELINES FOR STUDENTS Monsoon 2020   Department of Chemistry              Chemistry at Ashoka  The chemistry curriculum for undergraduate program in Ashoka University in the Monsoon 2020 semester is designed for students at all levels. The students majoring in Chemistry as well as those who are interested or doing minor, both will get benefit from this course. Meticulous understanding of chemistry for any students is the focus of th is syllabus.  Chemistry is involved in everything we do. Even if y ou are not chemist, every time you cook, bake, use the washing powder, toothpaste or taking medicine, you are dealing with chemicals . The study of Chemist ry provides a molecular level of description as well as insights into chemical bonding and give you a perfect picture of bond breaking and forming, overall a reaction. At Ashoka, our objective is to teach Chemistry in an integrative and holistic manner connecting with other branches of science, physics, biology, computer and environmental science . We are constantly trying to correlate with them and bring out the best int erest of our students. We are very hopeful to be an integrated part of Ashoka University in near future.  Further, the chemistry department is building up to do innovative and current research. This semester we have no lab course officially, but students interested to do any chemical reaction studying in theory class are always welcome and perform under the monitoring of professor s. The chemistry research requires to have a very sound knowledge on the basic of chemistry and our target is to build you up as an aspiring researcher through the basic concept of organic, inorganic and physical chemistry in this semester. We are very certain that this knowledge will take you further for any field of science or humanities.   The undergraduate Major in C hemistry  The chemistry major in Ashoka University designed with a belief that the students getting a degree in chemistry can take him/her wherever he/she want s to go, whether it is industry or immediate professional career, or further research in chemistry or intermediate subjects. The chemistry major must complete a total 14 courses to get a graduate degree from Ashoka University. This includes 7 core theory courses and 4 lab courses and any 3 electives. Courses offered by chemistry department or cross -listed with the chemistry department (if any) will also be counted. T he final year students will be offered proposal writing course and can pursue independent research in the department.  The core (theory) courses are:  • Energetics of Change (Semester II) • Basic Inorganic Chemistry (Semester III)  • Concepts in Organic Chemistry (Semester III)  • Atoms, quanta and light (Semester III)  • Inorganic Chemistry (Semester IV)  • Rate, order and mechanism (Semester IV)  • Mechanistic Organic Chemistry (Semester V) • Modern Methods of Analysis and Characterization (Semester V) • Organic Synthesis: Reagents and Synthetic Strategies (Semester VI)  Electives  Electives courses are there to broaden the knowledge of the core courses so that students c an have better understanding of the subjects. There are many courses Ashoka chemistry is offering. A major in chemistry must choose at least 3 electives to graduate.  Suggested Electives • Applied Organometallic & Coordination Chemistry • Environmental Analysis • Chemical Biology • Chemistry of Materials • Renewable Energy: Hydrogen and Solar Energy • Materials at nano scale • Computational Chemistry and Molecular Simulation • Environmental Chemist ry • Energy Materials: Batteries, Super capacitors etc  The undergraduate Minor in Chemistry  Students from different department are always encouraged to take chemistry as their minor. The knowledge will help a student to understand the science in our everyday life. This will also help to become a better researcher in any field of science. We believe it’s a great opportunity for a liberal university student.  To pursue minor in Chemistry at Ashoka, student must take 6 courses. This can include direct course offered from chemistry department or cross -listed (if any) with the department. 4 theory courses and a ny 2 electives can be chosen to complete a minor in Chemistry. Lab courses can be also considered as a minor subject.  Concentration in Chemistry  For taking concentration in Chemistry student must take minimum 4 courses and any 1 elective. In this case also lab course will be considered as a concentration subject.   Prerequisite  The professors require a minimum knowledge of a student for a course . It will be always mentioned in the webpage of chemistry about the prerequisite or students can directly ask the professors. For any introductory theory or lab course and any basic chemistry course no prerequisite requires. For example, ‘introductory labo ratory course’ (1401 -1) demands no prerequisite. For 1000/2000 level courses like ‘Chemistry for life’ no prerequisite needed, anybody can participate. Students from Physics, Biology and Environmental Science can take physical chemistry / theoretical chemis try, chemical biology and environmental chemistry course after discussing with the respective professors without any prerequisite .

1," 1 POLITICAL SCIENCE HANDBOOK     GUIDELINES FOR STUDENTS MONSOON 2020   2 Department of Political Science The undergraduate program of Political Science at Ashoka University aims to equip students with the ability to detect, critically analyse and reflect on the omnipresence of the “political” in the world we live in. Through a comprehensive grounding in the foundations of the discipline, we shall examine the natur e, distribution and dynamics of power – both at the macro level of national and international politics and also at the micro level of the individual, family and community. We will map the ways in which knowledge systems and challenges to particular power r elations have been constructed over specific vectors of time and space. We will study both Aristotle and Plato, Gandhi and Iqbal; complementing studies on comparative politics with an exploration of South Asia politics. The Political Science undergraduate curriculum at Ashoka exposes students early on to research methodologies, both qualitative (the ethnographic methods and qualitative modes of political analysis) and quantitative (statistics, political data handling, data visualization). Some of our course s put a lot of emphasis on experiential learning through fieldwork and field trips. Faculty Members : ● Ali Khan Mahmudabad ● Bann Seng Tan ● Gilles Verniers ● Malvika Maheshwari ● Matthew Baxter ● Madhav Khosla ● Neelanjan Sircar ● Pratap Bhanu Mehta ● Vinay Sitapati (Head of Department) ● Priyamvada Trivedi (Visiting)  Requirements for Major: Each student will take a total of 12 courses towards the major. For completing a major in Political Science, one must take the following courses (4 required courses +8 electives):  ● Western Political Thoughts (I) or Introduction to Political Theory ● Introduction to Comparative Politics ● Introduction to Indian Politics ● Quantitative Research Methods or Qualitative Research Methods ● Eight electives in Political Science (including a maximum of three cross -listed courses)   3 Requirements for Minor: Each student will take a total of 6 courses towards the minor. For completing a minor, a student has to take the following courses (3 required courses +3 electives):  ● Western Po litical Thoughts (I) or Introduction to Political Theory ● Introduction to Comparative Politics ● Introduction to Indian Politics ● Three electives in Political Science (including a maximum of 2 cross -listed courses)  Requirements for Concentration:  Each student will take a total of 4 courses towards the concentration. For completing a concentration, a student has to take any two of the required courses and two other electives (2 required courses + 2 electives):  ● Two required courses o ther than the methods’ courses ● Two electives in Political Science (including a maximum of 1 cross -listed course)  Requirements for Major in Politics and Society:  A student needs to take a total of sixteen courses, out of which one needs to take eight courses in Political Science. Out of those eight, four courses are mandatory, while rest four will be electives (4 required courses + 4 electives). The required courses from the Political Science side are:  ● Western Political Thoughts (I) or Introduction to Political Theory ● Introduction to Comparative Politics ● Introduction to Indian Politics ● Quantitative Research Methods or Qualitative Research Methods (in either Sociology & Anthropology or Political Science) ● Four electives in Political Science (including a maximum of 2 cross -listed courses)  Requirements for Major in Politics, Philosophy and Economics (PPE):  Each student needs to take a total of sixteen courses, out of which one needs to take a minimum of four courses in Political Science. If a student takes a minimum of eight courses in Political Science, then it would qualify for a Degree in PPE with a speci alization in Political Science. The mandatory courses from the Political Science side are (3 + 1/5):  ● Western Political Thoughts (I) or Introduction to Political Theory ● Introduction to Comparative Politics ● Introduction to Indian Politics ● One elective in Political Science (4)/Five electives in Political Science (8)  4 Note: In case of 4 courses in Political Science, a student can take a maximum of 1 cross -listed course. In case of 8 courses in Political Science, a student can take a maximum of 2 cross - listed courses.  Structure for the ASPs (4th Years):  For obtaining an Advanced Diploma in Political Science, students need to submit an initial statement of interest in April in their 3rd year, with the name of the preferred advisor(s). This state ment of interest should approximately be of two pages, highlighting preliminary details about the project. By the beginning of the ensuing summer break, students will be matched to an advisor, who may assist in structuring a thesis project over the summer.  In the first week of courses in the Monsoon semester of the 4th year, students will be expected to submit a thesis proposal that is 3000 -5000 words. These proposals will be assessed by the appointed advisor and a department -selected second reader (who is not an advisor) for quality, feasibility and clarity. Students will be given feedback on the proposal by the second week of courses, with one of three decisions: (i) reject , (ii) revise and resubmit , or (iii) pass . If the student is given a pass, then she or he may continue to the thesis program without qualification. If the student is given a revise and resubmit , then she or he may continue to the thesis program conditional on completing the requested revisions within one week. If the student is given a reject , then she or he may not continue into the thesis program.  Upon gaining entry into the thesis program, there are four requirements for the year:  • Attendance at a Year -Long Thesis Semin ar • End of Monsoon Semester Presentation • Final Thesis Presentation (End of Spring Semester) • Final Thesis Submission  The grading scheme across these requirements and relevant schedules will be shared with students before course enrollment commences for the Monsoon Semester. The final thesis will be graded by the advisor(s) and a department -selected second reader (who is not an advisor).  The thesis will be for 8 credits overall (4 in each semester). Students are expected to take at least three courses (12 credits) in Political Science during their advanced ma jor. They can also choose to TA for Political Science courses instead of an elective and gain credits. Beware that TAships are either for 2 credits or 4 credits so make sure that your credits tally properly. The number of credits for TAship is determined b y the faculty before the term. The department advises students to TA for only one course in a semester.  Additionally, each student will be provided a fixed research budget, which can be claim ed upon incurring the expenses. Additional budget can be provided upon request to the advisor and the Head of the Department.   5 Course Levels and Pre -requisites :  Generally, the 100 level courses are entry -level or introductory courses, while the 300 level courses are advanced. The department doesn’t impose a sequence of course as per the level, but strongly recommends that you clear entry -level courses before takin g advanced level courses. Some advanced electives will require you to take Quantitative Research Methods as a prerequisite.  For example (non -exhaustive list):  ● Quantitative Research Methods 2 : Students must have completed Quantitative Research Methods 1. ● Theoretical Political Economy : Students should have completed Quantitative Research Methods 1. They should have either completed or be enrolled in Quantitative Research Methods 2. ● Empirical Political Economy : Students should have completed Quantitative Re search Methods 1. They should have either completed or be enrolled in Quantitative Research Methods 2.  In the event that a course apart from these has some pre -requisites, it will be communicated at the starting of the semester.   Frequently Asked Questions  Q1: What are the compulsory courses for a Political Science major?  1. Western Political Thought I or Introduction to Political Theory 2. Introduction to Indian Politics 3. Introduction to Comparative Politics 4. Quantitative or Qualitative Research Metho ds  Q2: What are the compulsory courses for a Political Science minor?  1. Western Political Thought I or Introduction to Political Theory 2. Introduction to Indian Politics 3. Introduction to Comparative Politics  Q3: Is there a sequence in which I should take the required courses?  No. Q4: How many 100/200/300 level courses do I need to take?  6 There is no such requirement to take a specific number of courses of each level. Only the required courses are mandatory and can be taken in any sequence, irrespective of levels.  Q5: I’m going on a semester abroad. Can I substitute the required courses with a summer abroad course?  No. Required courses cannot be not substituted by summer courses.  Q6: Are Political Ideologies and WPT II compulsory courses?  No. Q7: What if I have done Political Ideologies/Introduction to Political Theory/Dynamics of State Formation in the past as a part of the requirement?  In case you have done Political Ideologies in Spring 2017 or Introduction to Political Theory in Spring 2018, you need not do WPT I. If you have done Dynamics of State Formation with Prof. Vinay Sitapati in the past, you fulfill the requirement for Introduction to Indian Politics. However, if you pursue these courses in any other semester, they will coun t only as electives and not as requirements , except for Introduction to Political Theory .  Q8: Can I take Political Ideologies/Introduction to Political Theory (electives) if I have done WPT I (required course) and vice versa?  Yes. Q9: Is WPT a pre -requ isite for WPT II?  No. We do recommend that you take WPT II after WPT I, but it’s not a pre -requisite.  Q10: Can I take a methods course in any other discipline?  Yes, you can, with validation from Prof. Sircar for quantitative courses and from the HoD for qualitative courses. In any case, you have to inform the HoD, the OAA and the Department Manager about this change.  Q11: How many cross -listed courses can I take?  Cross -listed courses are those courses which arise out of a discipline different from Political Science but are cross -listed with Political Science. Students can take upto two cross -listed course in a ny semester , provided all other rules are satisfied . The following is a summary of the rules around cross -listed courses:  ● Pure Major in Political Science: Maximum 3 ● ID Major in Politics and Society : Maximum 2 ● ID Major in PPE with 8 courses in Political Science: Maximum 2 7 ● ID Major in PPE with 4 courses in Political Science: Maximum 1 ● Concentration in Pol itical Science: Maximum 1 ● Minors in Political Science: Maximum 2  Q12: How can I get a course from another department cross -listed?  Write to the professor teaching that course to express your individual interest. Request the professor to directly email the course syllabus to the Head of Department, Political Science. The department will then take a collective decision , communicate with the professor directly , and then in form the students.  Q 13: I took a course which was cross -listed with Political Science. It is being offered again but is not showing as cross -listed. Is this a problem?  No. It is normal for courses to not be cross -listed with other departments in every semester that they’re offered. If you took a course, which was cross -listed in the semester that you took it, it will count towards your degree. Please cross -check the course code of such courses in your LMS.  Q14: Can I write a thesi s in the third year?  No. Only ASPs can write a thesis with the department. But you can do an ISM (Independent studies Module) with faculty. Some faculty offer ISMs – individual or group -based – others take proposals from students.  Q15: I’m interested in TAing for the Spring semester. How should I proceed?  Only ASP students are eligible to TA for courses. The department notifies all ASPs of TA requirement at the beginning of the semester and calls for applications. But in recent years there has been a scarcity of courses available for TA -ship. So students are advised not to depend upon it.  Q16: Can 4th year students opt out of an advanced major at a later stage  Yes, provided you fulfil other requirements meant for graduation.  Q17: Can students re -take the same course to get a higher grade.  Yes, but this is at the discretion of the professor offering the course. In case the new course is being offered by another professor (for example, because the original professor has left), the decision lies with the professor of the new course.  Q18: Whom should I contact for further queries?  8 You can email them to the Student Representative Vaibhav Parik <vaibhav.parik_asp21@ashoka.edu.in> or the Department Manager Anjali Panwar at anjali.panwar @asho ka.edu.in .

With a foundation laid in Chemistr y and Physics, this programme also involves under standing and learning from other disciplines such as Data Sciences, Climat e and Environmental Sciences, Social Sciences, and Humanities. Students and faculty at Ashok a are equal partners in this journe y. Our collectiv e aim is to generat e new knowledge and explore its applications to address social problems. While breadth across all scales of size and complexity in the life sciences is important for education and training in the undergraduat e and post-graduat e levels, we do give sufﬁcient attention to the depth that is needed for productiv e resear ch outcomes. In this direction, we have recently established The Trivedi School of Biosciences with the help of a gener ous donation from Mr. Ashok Trivedi. The school promotes advanced resear ch in Synthe tic Biology , Data Science, and emerging areas in disease biology . The school envisages state-of-the-ar t infrastructure, strengthening faculty number s in complementar y thematic areas, and continuous suppor t and ment orship in the pursuit of high-q uality resear ch capable of generating meaningful social impacts. The strength of Ashok a lies in its highly qualiﬁed faculty across all disciplines. Our bioscience faculty come trained from all over the world and are some of the best in their respectiv e ﬁelds, with expertise in areas that are not represent ed in India. Our faculty also: ® Innovate in biology education. ® Carry out experimental, computational/mathematical/theore tical biology resear ch. ® Collaborat e with afﬁliat ed faculty from other disciplines such as physics, chemistr y, mathematics, and data science who work on biological problems; the afﬁliat ed faculty also contribut e to teaching the students in the Biological Sciences programme. 2OVERVIEW OF UNDERGR ADUATE PROGR AM Students of Ashok a start by querying the growth of human thought, the origin and growth of the human civilization in general, and the Indian civilization in particular . They are introduced to the origin of scientiﬁc inquiry and study the relationships and inter-dependencies between science and other domains of human creativity and critical thinking. On this foundation, the fundamental principles of physics are taught to all students, in a way that brings in both, the elegance of the principles of the natural world, and the complexity that still needs be unra veled. Subseq uently , students are introduced to the chemical, biological, and human w orlds, no t as independent disciplines, but as a continuum of the ph ysical w orld. Mathematics is taught as a language that connects all these disciplines of science and also as an abstract method by which we under stand our surroundings. Our model of education is concept-based and inq uiry-driven, as opposed t o the more traditional cont ent- based models. Faculty at Ashok a pursue resear ch in those areas that are relat ed to the topics they teach to undergraduat e students. Our vision is to integrat e resear ch and teaching at all levels of science education. The Sciences at Ashok a will be rooted in experiments, but will not take the rigid “objectiv es, apparatus, method, and conclusion” form. Students learn through both, courses taught in the classr ooms, and by employing experimental methods in resear ch labs of the faculty . Students are also exposed to frontier s of science through seminar s, symposia, and national and international conferences that are routinely organized on the campus of Ashok a. The undergraduat e program in Biology is targe ted at students who have strong interests in Biology (Biology Major s) as well as those who are interest ed in learning more about Biology or for meeting their scientiﬁc temperament needs (Biology Minor s). Cour ses are taught keeping in mind that some students may or may not have prior exposure to basic concepts of Biology . All students majoring in the Sciences will have an oppor tunity to learn how to design an experiment and to implement that design, ﬁguring out the art of the appr oximation, under standing the power of simple models and how to conceptualize them, and developing the ability to convert an idea into mathematical or computational forms. The contents of the courses themselv es are equivalent in every way to those that are taught at the best universities outside of and within India. The Sciences at Ashok a will be rooted in experiments, but these will not take the rigid “objectiv es, apparatus, method, conclusion” form. At Ashok a, students will transf er concepts learnt in class into experimental thinking, verifying for themselv es the power and generality of scientiﬁc principles. Cour ses for Biology major s will provide a strong foundation for resear ch and career s in the biological sciences, medicine, pharmaceutical and biotech industr y, teaching, and other relat ed ﬁelds. A prospectiv e Biology major student is required to complete 11 core courses in Biology and 5 of the several optional courses offered in the Sciences along with the mandat ory 7 foundation courses. 3OVERVIEW OF P .D. PROGR AM h Ashok a University's Ph.D. program is designed to maintain global standar ds in education, training, productivity , and academic freedom. The Ph.D. program in Biological Sciences is charact erized by state-of-the-ar t laborat ories and computational infrastructure, gener ous suppor t to carryout ﬁeld work, accom plished faculty as resear ch ment ors, and gener ous scholar ship remunerations to all students. The unique liberal arts environment of the campus allows Ph.D. students to work on inter-disciplinar y resear ch projects drawing on the expertise of faculty member s within and beyond the biology depar tment. The four broad thematic areas that charact erize our resear ch are: 1. Bioph ysics and Biochemistr y 2. Cell and Developmental Biology 3. Com putational and Mathematical Biology 4. Ecology and Evolutionar y Biology All Ph.D. students under take complementar y course work to enable them to carry out resear ch in the areas of their interest. Ashok a gives maximum importance to training Ph.D. students in resear ch methodology , integrity , ethics, and written/oral communication. In addition, all Ph.D. students will have an oppor tunity to gain teaching experience by helping the faculty in teaching undergraduat e students. 4ADVANCED DIPL OMA The Biology Depar tment also offers a structured program for students who are interest ed in learning advanced concepts in biology and gain experience in some of the modern and interdisciplinar y areas of biology . This is in the form of an advanced diploma for students who have ﬁnished 3 years of undergraduat e in biology and relat ed area. The program is for one year. The major emphasis is to give oppor tunity to students to learn some of the advance and contemporar y topics in biology along with a hand-on experience in conducting research. Students with a major in a different disciple (chemistr y/ph ysics/maths/com puter science) are also eligible to join the Biology program. There is an oppor tunity to carry out interdisciplinar y resear ch in a number of areas in Biology . The program has been designed keeping in mind appr opriat e courses to ﬁll knowledge in gap areas and offer signiﬁcant resear ch oppor tunities UG LABS WITH ST ATE-OF-ART FACILITIES AND SAFETY FEA TURESSAFETY FEA TURES OUTSIDE LABS UG LABS 5Alok Bhatt acharya is Professor of Biology .

These have attract ed audiences ranging from high school students to international and national policy makers. Some of the conferences and meetings held last year were: Muscle and Diseases; Recent Advances in Under standing Disease Biology; Seminar Series on Ecology and Evolution; and Gene tics and Evolution: Intertwined Strands. These have been signiﬁcant in forging collaborations and providing a platf orm for students and faculty to exchange scientiﬁc ideas. Darwin-W allace Symposium The Darwin-Wallace student symposium is held every year in the month of November/December to give undergraduat e students an oppor tunity to discuss and present their resear ch on diverse aspects of ecology and evolution, ranging from climat e change and biodiv ersity, to the evolution of antibio tic resistance and modelling disease spread. Biology Colloquium During the academic year, we organise weekly colloq uia with international and national speak ers from different universities and specialisations within biology (on topics ranging from molecular gene tics to ecosyst ems ecology). We ensure that the list of invited speak ers reﬂect our inclusiv e outlook . Furthermore, we ensure that the majority of these talks reach beyond disciplinar y boundaries; this encourages students to pursue interdisciplinar y resear ch. These weekly colloq uia are followed by informal interaction sessions with the speak ers over pizza or a coffee. This tradition provides our students with an oppor tunity to ask questions relat ed to the speak ers' personal journe ys, resear ch traject ories, and the challenges that they have encount ered. 15A MESSA GE FROM ASHOKA'S STUDENT -LED SOCIETY OF BIOLOGY, THE BIOSOC: The Ashok a Biology Socie ty is a student-driv en initiativ e that brings together all aspects of the biological sciences to celebrat e them and make them more accessible to the student community .

They will work with plant and animal models from local ecosyst ems to empirically test concepts in population growth, competition, resour ce utilization, foraging beha viour , communication, ecological parame ters on bacterial growth (e.g. pH & temperature). The course aims at giving an experience of concepts and methods discussed in theor y courses of ecology and evolutionar y biology . Towards the end of this course, students will be able to design and implement appr opriat e methods for sampling individuals, populations and communities and ask questions on their diversity, stability and productivity . Modules dealing with beha vioral experiments will also demonstrat e potential errors that arise due to obser ver bias, signiﬁcance of blinded methods and other potential ways to improve the reliability of the data collect ed.

The answ er to this question lies within the inherit ed DNA. Gene tics have evolved phenomenally since Mendel ﬁrst introduced the concept of genes during the mid-1 800s. Today gene tics is used in all phases of life from food to medicines, new disco veries tend to manipulat e gene tics not only to diagnose and ﬁnd better cure for deadly diseases like cancer but also to design smar t plants and microbes to enhance the quality and quantity of food and secondar y metabolit es such as biofuel. Hence a thorough knowledge of gene tics is an absolut e requirement for biologists to comprehend the complex living organisms. This course will help you to acquire a thorough knowledge about the principles and concept of gene tics. We will start with the seminal disco veries chr onologically that led t o our under standing of gene tics t oday. Speciﬁcally , you will learn in details about inheritance of the gene tic materials and traits, structure and function of chromosomes and genes, mapping genes on the chromosome. We will then move on to study the key areas of gene tic variation and molecular gene tics and focus on model organisms used for gene tic studies. Subseq uently we will learn about the inheritance of complex traits and population gene tics. 28Cour se Details: ®Disco very of the basic principles of inheritance. ®Mendelian Inheritance ® Chromosomal basis of mendelism ®Sex-link ed inheritance ®Linkage and mapping ® Extension to Mendelian gene tics ®Cellular reproduction ® Extra chromosomal inheritance ®Chromosomal variation and its implications ® Mendelian principles applied to human gene tics ®Gene tics of bacteria and virus ® Proper ties of the gene tic materials ®Model organisms to study gene tics ®Molecular gene tics ® Introduction to Quantitativ e gene tics: Inheritance of complex traits (BIO-22 10/BIO-62 10) Intro to Cell and Molecular Biology Theor y 4 credits (Prereq uisite - Gene tics Theor y) Introduction: Cell is the fundamental unit of life. It carries out all (well… almost all!) the physiological processes essential for its survival and propagation. Within the cell, each of these processes is accom plished by molecular - machines. What are these processes and how do these mini machines carry out the cellular functions? How do these cellular machines know the right place and the right time to carry out appropriate functions? In this introduct ory Cell and Molecular Biology course, we will start by exploring some of the essential processes at the cellular level and under stand how the relevant molecular machines manage to carry out these processes with such amazing ﬁdelity and efﬁciency . The primar y focus of this course will be on eukaryotic cells, but as and when needed we will draw comparisons with prokaryotic cellular processes to appreciat e their similarities and distinctness. By the end of this course, the participant is expect ed to have a good conceptual grasp on basic cellular mechanisms, the molecular machineries involved, and their functional regulation within a cell.

I will start with very basic concepts and then slowly pace up to more advanced topics. During the course, I will primarily emphasize on two major aspects – (1) How do biologists infer the processes that contribut e to evolution? (2) Why is the under standing of evolutionar y patterns and processes critical for diverse areas of biological resear ch? In addition, I will also brieﬂy discuss (1) how do we read the primar y scientiﬁc literature? (2) How do we write about science? At the end of this course, I hope that the students will develop a broad under standing of the k ey concepts and theories in e volutionar y biology , including principles of natural selection and variation, sexual selection, population gene tics, quantitativ e gene tics, speciation and biodiv ersity, molecular evolution, co-evolution, and life history evolution. Finally and most importantly , I do not expect all the students to become professional evolutionar y biologists – but whether they become astrobiologist, athle tes, bureaucrats, entrepreneur s, movie stars or medical practitioner s, I hope that if they ever think about biology , they will be capable of appreciating the lens of evolutionar y processes.

It will emphasis on studying amino acids, proteins, enzymes as biological catalysts and under standing the chemistr y of enzymatic transf ormations. This course constitutes topics that cover lipids, carbohydrate, sugar, molecular metabolism, and membrane biochemistr y. 30Cour se details: ® Introduction of Cellular Chemistr y / Chemistr y of Life ®Carboh ydrat e Chemistr y ® Lipid and Fatty acids ® Amino acids and Proteins ® Protein structure ®Protein folding and chaper one ® Enzymology part 1: Introduction ®Enzymology part 2: Thermodynamic principles ® Enzymology part 3: Enzyme kinetics ®Vitamins and cofactors ® Biological membranes 1 (types and structure of lipids, phospholipids) ®Biological membranes 2 (ﬂuid mosaic model) ® Transpor t of Proteins through membrane ® Glycolysis, TCA cycle, Glyconeogenesis and glycogenolysis ® Amino acid and Fatty acid metabolism ®Nucleo tide Biosynthesis ®Protein expression and puriﬁcation (BIO-3020/BIO-6020) Ecology 4 credits (No prereq uisites, but completion of Evolutionar y biology is strongly recommended) Introduction: The course will cover a range of topics from individuals to ecosyst ems with an emphasis on theore tical foundations and recent developments in the ﬁeld. We will begin with how ecological under standing is achie ved, how conditions and resour ces inﬂuence individual species and then move to processes at higher levels of organization and end with rethinking some of the big questions in ecology . The topics covered will incluse physiological ecology , population ecology , species interactions, community ecology , succession and disturbance; ecosyst em ecology , and biogeochemistr y. Topics introduced in the lectures will be followed by in class-activities (and simulations) and discussions. For discussion sessions, I will suggest classic and recent resear ch paper s and students will lead discussions based on those. The course will allow to reﬂect on uncertainty and variation in natural processes from individual behaviour to ecosystem services. It is recommended strongly to take evolutionar y biology course prior to this, since this course will build on some of the modules covered in that course. Towards the end of this course, students will be able to (a) under stand how ecologists empirically study processes occurring at various scales and apply evolutionar y thinking to these processes (b) integrat e proximat e and ultimat e factors to under stand natural processes (c) quantitativ ely synthesize ecological resear ch (d) explore applications of ecological concepts such as conser vation, landscape management.

The systematic acquisition of data made possible by advances in genomics and proteomics technologies has creat ed a gap between the available data and its analysis leading to insights from the data. In addition, the data from multiple sources can be used to generat e hypothesis and answ er important questions.

This question has been addressed by various disciplines, including the ﬁelds of “Evolutionar y Psychology”, “Sociobiology” and “Physical Anthopology”. The common problem with the construction of the frame work of these ﬁelds is the chain of untested assum ptions underlying it, and the development of ideas unmoored to the physiological basis of either evolution or cognition. We will break down each model used to teach Evolutionar y Psychology to critically examine each system, and each system feeds into a larger under standing of what is involved in the evolution of cognitiv e abilities. This course looks at the question of whether there are aspects of beha viour and cognition that do and do not seem to have evolved in particular evolutionar y contexts. The ﬁrst step in our critical examination is to under stand what evolution does and does not mean in a Darwinian frame work; as well as whether and how cognition can be deﬁned and accurat ely assessed. We look at what aspects of beha viour are hardwired, and what is plastic. We under stand that evolution pertains to gene tic changes, and get a quick under standing of what gene tics constitut es. We then learn about epigenetics, gene expression, how the framework of genes and their expression drives physiological development of an embr yo, how the brain develops as a subse t of the body from a gene tic frame work, and about the relativ e ridigity and plasticity of parts of the brain during development and in adulthood. We then visit various questions in evolutionar y cognition, focussing on the historical debat es between the people who began extending the frame work of e volution t o under stand beha viour and cognition. The learning goals f or this class are to primarily learn how to distinguish an evidence-based under standing of evolutionar y cognition from what have been called “just-so” stories, which clog the public and even scientiﬁc realm.

Overview 1.1 Degree Requirements at Ashoka To graduate with a Bachelor’s degree, students are required to pass courses that are broadly divided into three categories – Foundation Courses ,Major Courses (including Interdisciplinary Majors) andCo-Curricular Courses . First year students typically take foundation courses in the ﬁrst 3-4 semesters at Ashoka, and start taking Major courses from the 2nd semester. You also have the option to take up a completely different subject as a minor or a concentration in addition to your major. Minors and Concentrations are brief programs taken in disciplines other than your major. Minors at Ashoka require you to take 6 courses in a discipline, while a concentration requires 4 courses. 1.2 GPA and Credit System Please note that University-wise credit requirements are subject to change, and the latest requirements are always available on the ofﬁcial website . At Ashoka, each course carries credit points - foundation courses as well as major speciﬁc and minor courses typically earn a student 4 credit points , while co-curricular courses give 2 credit points . In order to earn their degree at the end of three years, students pursuing a pure major (such as Computer Science etc.) need to have accumulated a minimum of 100 credits . On the other hand, students pursuing an interdisciplinary major (such as CS and Entrepreneurship etc.) must fulﬁll a minimum of116 credits . A student’s performance in any academic course is graded on a letter scale (ranging from A to F). Each grade carries a grade point (such as an A gives 16 grade points, while an A- gives 14.8). On this basis, at the end of every semester a student’s cumulative grade point average (CGPA) and semester speciﬁc GPA are calculated. For more on this, please refer to the section on Awards and Recognition (3.6).6 Chapter 1. Overview 1.3 CS at Ashoka The Department of Computer Science at Ashoka University acknowledges the increasing relevance of computing and information science to every academic discipline. In addition to classical and emerging areas of Computer Science, students have an opportunity to study interdisciplinary areas like computational biology, social and information networks, digital humanities and data-driven journalism. 2 interdisciplinary majors, a minor, a concentration are also offered by the Department in addition to an undergraduate major in Computer Science and a Ph.D. in Computer Science. The goals of the programme include (but are not limited to): 1.Impart a deep understanding of the foundations of Computer Science 2.Enable a student to be able to systematically apply the foundational knowledge across disci- plines 3.Create new knowledge in the ﬁeld of Computer Science 1.3.1 Programs Offered •Undergraduate –Major –Interdisciplinary Major –Advanced Major–Minor –Concentration •PhD •Graduate Assistantship 1.3.2 Faculty and Research Interests •Ravi Kothari , Professor (HOD Com- puter Science) Machine Learning, Pattern Recognition, Data Mining and Big Data •Sudheendra Hangal , Professor of the Practice in Computer Science Human- Computer Interaction, Social Media and Personal Digital Archives •Manu Awasthi , Associate Professor Com- puter Architecture, Operating Systems, and Computers & Society •Anirban Mondal , Associate Professor Ur- ban Informatics (Smart Cities), Spatial Databases and Financial Analytics •Mahavir Jhawar , Assistant ProfessorCryptography, Block-chain and Network Security •Debayan Gupta , Assistant Professor Se- cure Computation, Cryptography, and Pri- vacy •Goutam Paul , Associate Professor (Visit- ing - Spring 2020, Monsoon 2018) Cryp- tology, Security, Information and Coding Theory, Quantum Information and Compu- tation •Subhash Bhalla , Professor (Visiting - Monsoon 2020, Spring 2021) Distributed Database Systems, New Query Languages For a complete list of all faculty (core and visiting) and PhD students pursuing CS at Ashoka, visit thedepartmental website .2.

Academic Opportunities 3.1 Complimentary Disciplines Computer Science is a very versatile subject - with applications transcending multiple disciplines. At Ashoka, we have 2 interdisciplinary courses in CS, along with Entrepreneurship and Mathematics. Apart from these, it is also common for students studying CS at Ashoka to enroll in courses from Mathematics, Economics, Physics and Biology. 3.2 Study Abroad Programs Note that, like any other program at Ashoka, the Study Abroad Programs are subject to changes. Kindly refer to the GESP website for the latest information. Additionally, contact the departmental HOD for further clariﬁcation regarding credit transfers Every summer, international summer schools offer undergraduate courses in different subjects and ﬁelds. These courses can be transferred (subject to faculty approval) to the total credits taken as Ashoka. The Ofﬁce of Global Education and Strategic Programmes (GESP) is available to students for assistance and counselling in the application process. Ashoka is currently partnered with Wellesley College, UC Berkeley, University of Pennsyl- vania, Yale University, King’s College London, University of Michigan, Penn Engineering, Sciences Po, and Trinity College Dublin . Students can also apply for research and internship opportunities abroad to get practical experience in their ﬁelds of interest through a competitive process. These opportunities are available in Lehigh University, NTU Singapore, Koç University etc. For any enquiries on the process of applying for a summer/semester abroad, kindly email studyabroad@ashoka.edu.in 3.3 Teaching Assistantships As a TF/TA, you would be responsible for grading quizzes, holding discussion sessions and doubt clearing ofﬁce hours, as well as helping with the logistics for classes. A prospective applicant can12 Chapter 3. Academic Opportunities apply to TA for only those courses which they have already studied in Ashoka in the past. While preference may be given to seniors, anyone is welcome to apply for TAship by approaching the professor directly. Some courses may have different procedures, so do conﬁrm it with the instructor. 3.4 Independent Study Modules (ISM) Independent Study Modules (ISM) are 4-credit research projects that provide students an opportunity to work closely with a faculty member. These projects can either be research that faculty members are already working on or any other research topic that students may be interested in. If interested, you can simply approach a faculty member through email prior to the start of the semester, requesting them for guidance through an ISM. These count towards your electives. 3.5 Research Opportunities with Professors If you are interested in CS Research, it is a great idea to start working as a Research Assistant (RA) under a faculty member. In order to do so, you will have to personally approach faculty members in their ofﬁce hours and enquire whether you can assist them on current projects. Before seeking RA roles, make sure to have prior knowledge about the research interests of your faculty member. The CS Society also has plans of creating a uniﬁed Undergraduate Research Opportunities Platform to ease out this process. 3.6 Awards and Recognition •Dean’s List: The Dean’s List at Ashoka for any given semester includes the names of all students who, in the courses they have taken that semester, have scored a GPA of 3.65 or above. The Dean’s List is awarded on a semester basis. •Latin Honors: Students who have achieved scholastic distinction may be awarded the bach- elor’s degree with Latin honors at graduation. Honors appear on the ofﬁcial transcript and diploma. The criteria for these honors is as follows: 1.Cum Laude (With Distinction) - GPA >3.6 2.Magna Cum Laude (With High Distinction) - GPA >3.75 3.Summa Cum Laude (With Highest Distinction) - GPA >3.9 •Academic Achievement Awards: Gold Silver and Bronze Awards are awarded respectively to the students attaining the Top 3 Major CGPAs during graduation. •Undergraduate Research Excellence Awards: Awarded to the graduating student with the best track record in academic research, evaluated on the basis of publications and thesis quality. •Service Excellence Awards: Awarded for extraordinary service in department building through various activities..4. CS Clubs and Societies 4.1 CS Society The Computer Science Society at Ashoka University was founded in 2016 to strengthen the emerging CS culture on campus. It is an academic society that aims to create opportunities and resources for all students interested in this ﬁeld through a host of activities. Past events include Mahavamsa - Ashoka’s ﬁrst programming contest, hackathons, cryptic hunts, talks and workshops. Students across majors and disciplines are welcome to join! The CS Society is currently undergoing major structural changes. These include: •Formation of sub-departments such as Competitive Programming ,Software Development , Machine Learning and Data Science as per the interests of the student members of the society. •Weekly training and mentor-ship programs , occasionally involving well qualiﬁed guest instructors. •Creating a uniﬁed portal for Undergraduate Research Opportunities - to bring interested undergraduates and faculty members, PhD students etc. together. •A larger presence on social media and public forums, including a public website and technical blogs. Reach out to us at cs.society@ashoka.edu.in.14 Chapter 4. CS Clubs and Societies 4.2 Women in Computing Society (WiCS) Founded by an Ashoka alumnus, Simran Bhuria, and launched on campus by Mrs. Rashmi Mohan, an ACM eminent speaker on 29th September 2016, Women in Computing Society is a small bunch of passionate students working towards making the CS culture at Ashoka a safer, healthier, and inclusive one. We also focus on supporting everyone in CS, especially womxn, academically and personally. We constantly work towards building a larger community of womxn in CS that is collaborative and supportive in nature. As an academic society, we organise talks, hackathons, cryptic hunts, workshops, problem-solving centered stalls and events, and reading groups. As a part of our larger vision of an inclusive community, we organise events focused on activism – blog posts, discussions on gender in academic spaces and sexism, sessions on building conﬁdence and tackling other challenges for womxn in STEM and movie screenings! 1.WiCS cryptic hunts: We have had multiple hunts since the inception of WiCS based on different themes in collaboration with other societies such as – Ashoka’s Philosophy Society, Ashoka’s Psychology Society, Sandhi (Ashoka’s Languages Society), Ashoka Society for Politics, etc. 2.Workshops: These are focused on tools and skills useful for students in CS and beyond. We have done workshops on Git, web development, programming for beginners (Programming without Code), Excel/Google Sheets etc. 3.Interactive sessions: Some of the sessions we have organised in the past: a session with Prof. Jennifer Widom, Stanford University at Ashoka (2018), a Capstone Student Panel Discussion with senior students and alumni, an open house for CS students focused on discussions around gender in academic spaces, mixers for CS womxn. 4.Problem-solving centered stalls at fests and Haats: These were our attempts at sharing the joy of solving puzzles and love for algorithms with others at Ashoka. 5.Hackathons, collaborative work sessions focused on competitive programming, and unwinding sessions. Reach out to us at wics@ashoka.edu.in. 4.3 Special CS Events •CS Mixer: The CS Mixer is a unique initiate undertaken by the Department of CS every year, intended primarily to introduce the CS freshers to the seniors and members of the faculty. It is a fun event where you get to interact with all the faculty members, seek quick advice, all while enjoying free food! •Mahavamsa: Mahavamsa is Ashoka’s ﬁrst coding contest. It is a 48 hour coding contest with lots of cash prizes to be won. The contest is open to all current students of Ashoka University. Beginners and non-CS majors are also encouraged to participate. All you need is basic programming knowledge in a language of your choice! The ﬁrst edition of Mahavamsa was held in Spring 2020 and the CS Society intends to make it a recurring event.5.

When in doubt, feel free to bug her with anything CS related. 5.2 Faculty Advice 5.2.1 General Advice Welcome to CS@Ashoka! Computer Science, goes the joke (hint: they’re not joking), has little to do with com- puters and is not really a science. If you really push me, I’d say that it is a study of processes, of understanding why and how things happen, and their inherent complexity: is one problem truly harder than another? E.g., is it more difﬁcult to ﬁnd a square root than a 3rd root? Why? (Maybe there’s an easy trick for one and we’re just being stupid.) Personally, I love this subject because it’s the closest thing to magic we have. We create our incantations (computer programs), prepare the appropriate sacriﬁces (sleep is the common currency used by undergraduates, I believe), and wave our wands (or macbooks dual-booting linux): our spells can travel across the world across the only planetary-scale infrastructure ever built by humanity, jumping across chains of electrons and photons in a system that stores (nearly) the sum total of human knowledge (and ignorance). Our spells can analyse your iris and detect diabetes well before any medical doctor could, and also tell the hospital how to best optimise their supplies; they can navigate our spacecraft across unimaginable distances and help us understand the universe; they can connect us all through social media and buoy industry through a pandemic via e-commerce. There’s a dark side as well - all things can be misused. I hope to teach you a lot about computer science. But I don’t just want well-trained worker bees: I want brilliant, nuanced thought; I want technical knowledge balanced by moral ﬁbre; but most of all, I want each and every one of you to become the very best human beings you can be (that, and understand pointers properly). PS. Yes, computer scientists tend to use more parentheses than most other people (and what’s wrong with that?). -Debayan Gupta , Assistant Professor, Ashoka University5.3 Post-Ashoka Journey 17 5.2.2 Book/ Resource Recommendation Textbooks/ Reference books recommended by Faculty: 1.Introduction to Algorithms by Cormen, Leiserson, Rivest, and Stein 2.The C Programming Language by Kernighan and Ritchie 3.The C++ Programming Language by Bjarne Stroustrup 4.Database System Concepts by Avi Silberschatz 5.Computational Complexity: A Modern Approach by Barak and Arora 6.Introduction to Modern Cryptography by Katz and Lindell 7.Cryptography and Network Security by Stallings 8.Compilers: Principles, Techniques, and Tools by Aho, Lam, Sethi, and Ullman 9.Artiﬁcial Intelligence: A Modern Approach by Norvig and Russell 10.Computer Networks by Tanenbaum 11.Computer Architecture: A Quantitative Approach by Hennessy and Patterson 12.Modern Processor Design by Shen and Lipasti Other fun reads: 1.Gödel, Escher, Bach by Douglas Hofstadter 2.I am a Strange Loop by Douglas Hofstadter 3.The Art of Computer Programming by Donald E.

Ashoka University offers a 3-month long summer break, which you can utilize productively by interning. It is advisable to search for summer internships at least 2-3 months prior to the start of the break - most ﬁrms or research centers have deadlines that you should research about as early as possible. Moreover, Ashoka University’s Career Development Ofﬁces (CDO) also provide internship opportunities through ﬁrms that recruit interns on campus. If you’re applying through CDO, keep your SuperSet proﬁle updated to avoid last-minute hassle. For CS speciﬁc internships, do occasionally brush up on your Data Structures and Algorithms . 5.3.2 On Letters of Recommendation from Faculty Graduation School applications often require letters of recommendation from faculty during the admissions process. An optimal letter-writer should ideally have you in at least one class or should have supervised you in research, thesis, or other work. Moreover, their contact with you should be relatively recent. You might also want to consider how well you performed in their class or work and whether you have had interactions with them outside of the classroom. Note that different professors may have different rules related to Letters of Recommendation, thus make it a point to get in touch with your desired letter-writer and clarify all details well in advanced. Also, approach the faculty at least 2 weeks in advanced for them to be prepared.18 Chapter 5. Additional Resources and Advice 5.3.3 Alumni Experiences in the Industry Barun Parruck (UG’19) Q:What does your current role at Google India entail? A:I’m a Software Engineer 2 at Google, speciﬁcally an iOS full stack developer within the Google One team. My day to day work involves ﬁxing bugs assigned to me, proposing and implementing new features, and writing unit tests for these features. Q:You were active on competitive programming websites. How helpful do you think that was in helping you secure an internship at Microsoft and the subsequent job offer? A:They were perhaps the main feature of how I got the internship. Getting the job offer from the internship was a completely different task, and primarily involved making extensive contributions to their codebase and presenting and demo’ing my additions constantly over the period of the internship. Q:During your time at Ashoka, what were your favorite courses? Other than Program- ming, what area of CS intrigued you the most? A:Software Debugging is probably the most useful course I’ve ever taken. Most of my interest lies in either algorithmic problem solving or full stack web development and software architecture. My favourite course was Databases and Data Mining (Debapriyo Majumdar), followed closely by Computer Organization and Systems (Vivek Seshadri) Q:Any pitfalls one should avoid while studying CS at Ashoka? A:Avoid taking too many courses (though deﬁnitely attend a single class of every single course, just in case you’re missing out on some exceptional professors). I think a lot of people get caught up with the idea that the goal is the submission of the assignment. I’ve had bad grades now and then - but I’ve tried my best to make sure that every assignment submitted wasn’t for the submission but for the content. And start early! :P Q:What advice would you give to undergraduates who wish to join the industry? A:Deﬁnitely I’d say you need to focus on getting your interviews right. I seem to do pretty well in traditional SWE interviews and a large part of that comes from my competitive programming background, as well as just grinding leetcode and practicing mock interviews a lot. If you don’t interview often, it’s quite likely that stress will act up and cause you to perform subpar. And reach out to seniors, professors, anybody - connections are important in the industry re: getting referrals. Participate in all the popular company recruitment drives like the Facebook Hacker cup, or the Google Code jam/kickstarter. And ﬁnally, you can always reach out to recruiters on Linkedin if you’ve got a decent proﬁle to be able to bring a more personal touch to the applications you make Barun Parruck is a Software Engineer at Google Inc. He was formerly a Software Engineer at Microsoft where he had also interned in his junior year. As a student, Barun was very active on competitive programming websites like Codeforces5.3 Post-Ashoka Journey 19 Nishka Dasgupta (ASP’19) Q:What does your current role at Microsoft Research Lab, India entail? A:I work as a Research Fellow. Under the guidance of my manager, I am currently trying to develop efﬁcient protocols in Multiparty Computation (MPC). Q:What do you think, helped you secure your current role? A:Both my previous summer internships had been research-focused, speciﬁcally on cryptography projects, so that certainly played a factor. By fortunate coincidence, my most recent internship before I applied had been in multiparty computation (MPC), and the manager whom I applied to work with was also interested in MPC at the time, so our research interests aligned. Having strong recommendations also helped. Q:How should one prepare for job/internship searches? A:While not every role will have the same requirements, there are some general best practises that have helped me. Cover your bases before any interview or exam; a lot of interviews, even for speciﬁc roles, often expect a breadth of basic knowledge anyway. Be prepared to network and ﬁnd out which of your professors (especially professors who have a positive impression of you) knows someone who knows someone who works at your dream company/university. Talk to your seniors, batchmates and professors as well, to learn about opportunities you would not have heard of otherwise (that’s how I learned about the RF programme at MSR). Don’t take rejection personally; focus on learning from your mistakes. Try not to bluff too hard about your interest or knowledge regarding any ﬁeld/professor unless you are prepared to put in the work until you really are as dedicated/knowledgeable as you claimed to be. Q:Any pitfalls one should avoid while studying CS at Ashoka? A:As most of the professors don’t really impose a speciﬁc language, it can be easy to get too comfortable with only one language. This is a mistake. Look for excuses to learn new languages or frameworks that you are not being forced to learn in a class, especially those popularly used in your preferred ﬁeld (e.g most big crypto projects are written in C/C++) or in the industry at large. Python is delightful up until your job interviewer asks you questions about memory errors in C. Although mathematics courses are not compulsory for CS at Ashoka, some ﬁelds (and grad schools) will expect certain courses (e.g a Linear Algebra requirement for AI focused programmes; a Number Theory requirement for theoretical crypto). If you have a preferred ﬁeld, do your research on what is needed (talk to relevant professors too) and plan your courses accordingly. Q:Any advice for undergraduates about the Industry? A:Long working hours are, unfortunately, the norm, whether in research or in development. Especially near deadlines, sleep can be hard to come by. So, start working on your ability to handle stress. In research speciﬁcally, you will often be expected to take the lead and start making suggestions instead of waiting for your mentor to tell you what to do next; if you have trouble with that, start practising. Nishka is a Research Fellow at Microsoft Research Labs, India. She has interned at Nanyang Technlogical University - Singapore, and Tata Institute of Fundamental Research - Mumbai, as an undergraduate researcher.20 Chapter 5. Additional Resources and Advice 5.3.4 Alumni Experiences in Higher Education Anavi Kajla (ASP’18) Q:You pursued your Masters in Human-Computer Interaction. How good a ﬁeld, in your opinion, is HCI for someone who wants to study Computer Science in sync with the Humanities? A:HCI is a highly interdisciplinary ﬁeld and can draw from virtually any discipline. A degree in CS and then going into HCI is highly beneﬁcial because you have a deeper understanding of software development and various technical constraints. Ultimately, any job in UX will involve a high degree of communicating with developers about the designs you create and knowing how they work gives you an advantage. Q:You have also interned at Amazon. What skills do such companies look for while hiring students who specialize in UI/UX? Do Data Structure and Algorithm skills take prece- dence? Or are Software Engineers who work on UI/UX projects evaluated differently? A:There are 4 paths someone interested in UI/UX can take: UX Designer, UX Engineer, Visual Designer and UX Researcher. Skills & evaluation depends on which role you’re interested in and usually doesn’t require knowledge of CS concepts we’re taught in our major. I would highly recommend looking up these specializations for a more in-depth understanding of what each role entails and where your interests/strengths lie. There are skills common to all these that employers typically look for: a portfolio of projects (super important!), storytelling skills, creative problem-solving and the ability to communicate well with others. In my case, I was exclusively an SDE and didn’t have much of a UI/UX component in my internship apart from working on a small front-end project. Q:What parameters would you advise an undergrad at Ashoka to focus on, if they wish to pursue graduate studies in Human-Computer Interaction? A:Since most CS classes at Ashoka have a project component in them, it would be beneﬁcial if students could go and talk to actual users of the product they’re building and get feedback on it! This would help them understand the importance/role of UX in product development and also, make for a great portfolio project. Apart from that, getting familiar with various prototyping tools (eg. Sketch, Figma) is a great place to start developing interaction & visual design skills. Some of these tools also offer students free plans! And, front-end skills are a bonus too. Q:Are there any pitfalls one should avoid while studying CS at Ashoka? A:The Ashoka CS department has grown a lot since I graduated and students should take advantage of the variety of classes offered to develop their interests. When I was attending, my batchmates & I would take whichever course was offered so we could complete our major! It didn’t afford us the ﬂexibility to take classes that we were genuinely interested in. Apart from one introductory HCI class in my second year, I wasn’t able to study more topics in the ﬁeld. But now hopefully you can!5.3 Post-Ashoka Journey 21 Q:What advice would you give to undergraduates who wish to eventually join the industry in a similar ﬁeld? A: –Try to involve users in your class projects early to get a feel of the work you’ll be doing as a UXer –Working on a portfolio takes time, so start early! (look here for inspiration) –Research the ﬁeld and it’s many specializations well before you decide to take the leap - it’s not for everyone Anavi is currently a product designer at the Library of Congress - USA. She pursued her Masters in Human Computer Interaction from the University of Maryland-College Park. She has also interned at Amazon as a Software Development Engineer Pratyush Ranjan Tiwari (ASP’20) Q:What are your current research interests? A:My main research area of interest is cryptography. My areas of interests within cryptography are veriﬁable computation, quantum cryptography, privacy-preserving techniques and funda- mentals of cryptography. I am particularly interested in designing protocols with minimal trust requirements. Q:What undergraduate research that you have undertaken are you the proudest of? A:Two main projects: a) Is the paper I published at IEEE Security and Privacy on the Blockchain titled CryptoWills, which is a protocol for secure and private last wills for cryptocurrencies. This allows for people’s funds in cryptocurrencies to be distributed to their loved ones after they passed away, this is a ﬁrst protocol solving that problem. b) Security & Privacy and attacks on Aadhaar: I worked on this with a big team of people at Ashoka under Prof. Debayan Gupta. My personal contribution was towards the cryptography used in Aadhaar, I devised the biggest attack on Aadhaar till date. The paper is embargoed and we are awaiting govt. permission to publish. Q:Any pitfalls one should avoid while studying CS at Ashoka? A:Don’t do things because other people think they’re cool. Find out for yourself if working for a big tech company will actually be your dream job. Since Ashoka is new and we don’t really get the FAANG companies to visit and hire, people at Ashoka CS often develop this fantasy for such jobs. Do internships to ﬁgure out what a career in a particular direction is like, do an internship with some startup in Bangalore/some other city in India (and abroad too if you can) to ﬁnd out what it’s like living that life. Intern at a university in India (and abroad too if you can) to ﬁgure out what life in academia is like. Bottomline, whatever possible career trajectories you want to try out, do that a lot, even if it costs you some grades (tbh, don’t drop below 3.5 tho).Start looking for internships for the next summer from August, ask professors to connect you with people. After the summer before 4th year you can basically have a plan then on what to do next. Finding jobs/grad schools etc. will take a year and thats’ what the22 Chapter 5. Additional Resources and Advice 4th year is for. Try different dept. at Ashoka and their courses, doing interdisciplinary things opens new doors career wise. Only work with people you enjoy working with. Don’t fall into the classic CS stereotype, and be healthy, well rounded and don’t let your major be your identity. Q:How should one prepare for Grad School applications? A:Once you know you’re applying the most important aspects are 1.Published papers/pre-prints : Pre-prints are fully written papers which are not yet accepted for publishing. This is the easiest foot-in-the-door from the perspective of admission committees. If you don’t have this yet, I would suggest getting at least a pre-print worthy research idea, working on it and then applying. 2.Recommendation: Only ask people who will recommend you 110% positively, make you look awesome. Try to get someone very successful in your research area/ﬁeld to write a rec, this person should be preferably from outside Ashoka. The way to do this is to get internships with people like this and then working super hard to impress them. 3.Grades: Sorry but yes, the higher your grades the better your chances in general. However, everything above a 3.8 is the same. The big brackets I would say are a) 3.8+ b) 3.5+ c) 3.2+ d) apply later. In case of d) do something awesome to stand out, like publish a paper at a top venue to stand out, work somewhere popular, get a recommendation from someone who is super popular in the ﬁeld and only then apply. Or go to an okayish place for a Master’s and then improve. Q:Any advice for undergraduates about the higher studies in CS? A:If you haven’t done any research, then don’t go to grad school. Only go to grad school if you’ve worked on research problems, and know that you want to take advanced courses and also do more research. Don’t go if you’re unsure/ because don’t have anything else lined up. Ideally you should pay 0 for grad school, and arguably go only when you don’t have to pay. Pratyush is a passionate cryptographer, pursuing his PhD from John Hopkins University. He was also accepted to NYU’s Courant School of Mathematics. His internship experience includes research roles at Indian Institute of Technology-Madras, Chennai Mathematical Institute, Dunya Labs, and Celo-Berlin.5.3 Post-Ashoka Journey 23 Vineet Reddy (ASP’20) Q:You were accepted to some very reputed departments like NYU Tandon and UChicago. What path did you tread as an undergraduate that helped you secure these? A:I think having a solid research/project experience in your undergrad really sets you apart from other students. Keep in mind that Ashoka CS still does not have the same reputation as that of other programs in India (think IIT’s IIIT’s and BITS). I think focusing on this can be really useful when one is applying to graduate programs. Also, developing good rapport with your professors helps as you’ll need their references when you start applying. Q:According to you, what sets someone apart when applying to universities for a Masters in CS? A:From what our professors have told me - SoP and your LoRs seem to matter, by far, the most. While your GPA is important, most of the time, it your SoP and LoRs that set you apart from every other applicant. Stufﬁng them with solid references and good content should really help. Q:What is the next ’big’ thing you aspire to achieve? A:Ideally, work as a Software Developer in one of the Big 4 tech companies. Something long term would be to retire as soon as possible! Trust me, slogging off at work sucks. Q:Any pitfalls one should avoid while studying CS at Ashoka? A:One of the biggest pitfalls I noticed coming from an engineering program was how the education for most CS majors ends with the classroom. Most of the stuff I picked up was by doing random side projects and messing around with some popular libraries. Don’t just do what your courses tell you to, pick up random stuff and just work on it – you’ll probably learn a lot more than what your courses teach. Q:Any advice for undergraduates about the higher studies in CS? A:Work hard in Discrete Math and Algorithms! They’re super important courses that I should have paid a lot more attention to. Don’t worry too much about your grades, they’ll be ﬁne as long as you put in a bit of effort. Don’t just be a one trick pony – learn more than Python. Most of all, enjoy your time at Ashoka, it’s going to be great. Vineet is a Machine Learning Enthusiast, and was accepted to Masters programs at the New York University, University of Chicago, University of Massachusetts Amherst, and University of Maryland. Due to the ongoing COVID-19 crisis, he has decided to defer his admit to the next year. He’s currently working as a software development engineer at EACIIT - a Singapore based Big Data Analytics leader.24 Chapter 5. Additional Resources and Advice Aditya Singh (ASP’20) Q:What is the most important advice you would give juniors who wish to get into top Masters programs? A:I think the most important thing is to actively engage with the material and faculty while taking courses. Before making the decision to apply for further studies, it’s important to be clear about what one would like to study further. Personally, being involved in various different projects helped me in identifying the areas I really wanted to focus on and pursue further. Q:According to you, which aspect of your application was most instrumental in you getting accepted into top universities? A:Applying for postgraduate studies is a pretty holistic process so pinpointing one single aspect is difﬁcult. I think having industry exposure along with some research experience is helpful as it shows versatility, which then also reﬂects in the recommendations. Doing decently well on standardized tests is essential as they act as a virtual cutoff for some universities. The statement of purpose is also as important as anything else and should be thoroughly reviewed. Q:Any pitfalls one should avoid while studying CS at Ashoka? A:I can’t say in general, but in my experience, I found that it’s easy to become a little disconnected and solely grade obsessed at Ashoka, which is a detrimental mindset to have. Making the effort to interact and grow with not only your professors, but also your peers, goes a long way in helping you get the most out of the time you spend here. Q:How would you compare research experience and industry internships when it comes to applying to Masters programs in grad schools? A:I think it really depends on the sort of programs and universities one is targeting. For more theoretical and research-based programs I emphasized my research experience with professors at Ashoka and outside, whereas for programs that are also directed towards the industry (like data science, information systems, etc.) I put more emphasis on the internships. The recommendation letters also varied correspondingly. Again, it’s helpful to identify the area one would like to pursue, and plan the summer/winter commitments accordingly. Q:As you will be studying Computational Data Science at CMU, what is the most impor- tant skill people interested in Data Science must cultivate? A:I think the most important skill to cultivate would be to keep your fundamentals in mathematics strong, especially in subjects like linear algebra and real analysis. One might be able to intuitively understand how CNNs look for features across visual data, but knowing how the process of Stochastic Gradient Descent works is as important. Aditya plans to attend Carnegie Mellon University for an MS in Computational Data Science.

The general syntax of one’s email is <ﬁrstname>.<lastname>_<batch>@ashoka.edu.in and you can use this format to look up/ contact anyone at Ashoka. Keep in mind that if one has multiple active email addresses, you will need to use your discretion, as follows: –If one has separate aspandugemails, contact them on their latest email (i.e aspin this case). Similarly, contact alumni on their alumni email ID. –Contact your TAs and TFs on their TA IDs, and not their personal emails, for course- related queries - makes their lives easier •If you do now know who to contact for anything remotely related to Computer Science, you should probably contact the CS Representative ﬁrst.

5,"    ​ DEPARTMENT OF PHILOSOPHY    STUDENTS’ HANDBOOK             DISCLAIMER: ​ If any information presented in this handbook is in conflict with any       information provided on the department website    ( ​ https://www.ashoka.edu.in/page/philosophy-115 ​ ), then the information on the    department website should be considered correct and final.  About the Department  Philosophy grapples with fundamental questions about the nature of reality, knowledge, and how       we ought to act. Whether in the Indian or Western tradition, answers to these questions have         been supported by rigorous arguments. Our courses offer a historically sensitive immersion in       these arguments. Nevertheless, the philosophy major at Ashoka University aims to equip       students to work beyond the parochialism of either the Indian or Western philosophical tradition        to do philosophy without boundaries.  The philosophy major will equip students with critical reasoning and analytical problem-solving       skills, expressive precision, and the intellectual spaciousness to appreciate and engage rationally       with arguments and points of view with which they profoundly disagree. The Ashoka Philosophy        graduate will be well prepared for higher studies in philosophy or a career in e.g. media, law,         business, or consulting.  People  Current Faculty Members  1.

Symbolic Logic; Category: RC (Offered every monsoon semester) 3. 2 courses categorised as IN (Non-western Philosophy requirement) 4. 2 courses categorised as HW (History of Western Philosophy requirement) 5. 3 courses categorised as CC (Contemporary Core requirement)  6. 3 elective courses (These can be from any of the following categories: HW/IN/CC/EO)  Any students completing a major in philosophy should complete 48 credits in PHI category        courses, that is, they must complete 12 four-credit courses in philosophy.  Philosophy Minor  The requirements for a minor in philosophy are as follows (6 courses):  1. Introduction to Philosophy; Category: RC (Offered every spring semester)  2. Symbolic Logic; Category: RC (Offered every monsoon semester) 3. 1 course categorised as IN (Non-western Philosophy requirement) 4. 1 course categorised as HW (History of Western Philosophy requirement) 5. 1 course categorised as CC (Contemporary Core requirement)  6. 1 elective course (These can be from any of the following categories: HW/IN/CC/EO)  Any students completing a minor in philosophy should complete 24 credits in PHI category        courses, that is, they must complete 6 four-credit courses in philosophy.  Philosophy Concentration  The requirements for a concentration in philosophy are as follows (4 courses):  1. Introduction to Philosophy; Category: RC (Offered every spring semester)  2. Symbolic Logic; Category: RC (Offered every monsoon semester) 3. 2 courses (These can be from any of the following categories: HW/IN/CC/EO)**  **The courses cannot be from the same category. For eg: If the first course is from IN, the other          course should be from CC, HW, or EO.  Any students completing a concentration in philosophy should complete 16 credits in PHI       category courses, that is, they must complete 4 four-credit courses in philosophy.  PPE Major with Philosophy Concentration  The philosophy course requirement for a PPE major with a concentration in philosophy are as follows (8 courses):  1. Introduction to Philosophy; Category: RC (Offered every spring semester)  2. Symbolic Logic; Category: RC (Offered every monsoon semester) 3. 1 course categorised as IN (Non-western Philosophy requirement) 4. 1 course categorised as HW (History of Western Philosophy requirement) 5. 1 course categorised as CC (Contemporary Core requirement)  6. 3 elective course (These can be from any of the following categories: HW/IN/CC/EO)  Any students completing a PPE major should complete 32 credits in PHI category courses, that        is, they must complete 4 four-credit courses in philosophy.  PPE Major without Philosophy Concentration  The minimum philosophy coursework requirement for a PPE major in philosophy are as follows (4 courses):  1. Introduction to Philosophy; Category: RC (Offered every spring semester)  2. Symbolic Logic; Category: RC (Offered every monsoon semester) 3. 2 courses (These can be from any of the following categories: HW/IN/CC/EO)**  **The courses cannot be from the same category. For eg: If the first course is from IN, the other          course should be from CC, HW, or EO.  Any students completing a PPE major should complete at least 16 credits in PHI category        courses, that is, they must complete 4 four-credit courses in philosophy.  If a student on a track to completing a PPE major wants to take more courses in philosophy          beyond the minimum requirements, they can do so. The other courses can be from HW, IN, CC,         or EO category. However, such students are advised to get in touch with the PPE department or         their academic advisor to ensure that they are completing all other requirements for the PPE        degree.  A student cannot complete both a PPE major and a minor in philosophy.  FAQs  1. Do I need to take the philosophy courses in some specific order?  Prima facie, no. However, higher-division philosophy courses sometimes have     prerequisites - students are advised to check with the course instructor for such       prerequisites. Moreover, doing philosophy requires rigorous skill in reading a text      closely, writing critically, logical analysis, and sound argumentation. These skills are      often acquired in lower-division courses and it is advisable (but not obligatory) to take        the Introduction to Philosophy and the Symbolic Logic courses before taking      higher-division classes in philosophy.  2. Can I do a thesis before my fourth year (ASP)?  Yes, that is possible. But it will count as an Independent Study Module (ISM).  3. I am not a philosophy major. I want to complete a philosophy thesis in my ASP year. Can          I do so?  Yes, that is possible - all you need to do is find a professor who is willing to supervise          your work. However, it is recommended that you should take some philosophy courses       before doing a thesis.  4. I am taking a philosophy course. I do not know whether it is listed as RC/         IN/HW/CC/EO. How do I find out?  This is easy - just go to the department website page and click on course archive section         ( ​ https://www.ashoka.edu.in/page/philosophy-115 ​ ).  5. Is there a possibility to get a waiver for any of my degree requirements?  Yes, there is a possibility. You need to discuss with your academic advisor and the Head         of the Department of Philosophy.  6. My question is not listed here. Whom should I approach?  If you cannot find your question here, please write to the student representative of the        philosophy department. ",a2d322d7-f7e4-496e-abdb-8c33226af98c

Students are not expected to declare their Major until the middle of the second year. This is to ensure that they get plenty of time to try out various possibilities, to pursue extra-curricular and co-curricular interests, to discover new passions, and perhaps to change the trajectory of their lives. Students enrolled at Ashoka University can choose their Major from a total of 12 pure or 9 interdisciplinary options. Students can also pick Minors from among 21 disciplines and concentration from among 19 disciplines on offer. Over the duration of their undergraduate programme, it is mandatory for students to undertake 9 Foundation Courses and 2 Co-curricular Courses. To graduate with a Bachelor’s degree from Ashoka University, students must pass courses that are broadly divided into three categories – Foundation Courses, Major Courses (including Interdisciplinary Majors) and Co-Curricular Courses. Each course carries credit points, and in order to earn their degree at the end of three years, students pursuing a pure major need to have accumulated a minimum of 100 credits, students pursuing an interdisciplinary major a minimum of 116 credits. The course divisions and credits pure majors need to acquire within three years are as follows: 9 Foundation Courses (36 credits) 12 Major Courses (48 credits) * , **  2 Co-Curricular Courses (4 credits) Other (Elective, Minor, Concentration) (12 credits) *Students working towards an approved Interdisciplinary Major must take a minimum of 16 (64 credits) courses – i.e. four courses more than what is required for a pure Major. **Some departments have implemented additional requirements such as a higher number of required Major Courses. Students should consult the website of the respective programme or inquire with the respective department to ensure that they are aware of the requirements specific to their Major.  Students can also take additional courses during the three years. A number of Minors are also offered at Ashoka. To qualify for a Minor, students must take 6 courses (24 credits) in a programme outside their field of Major specialisation.  For details regarding the more specific requirements students must meet (e.g. the kinds of courses students must take to qualify for a Minor), please consult the website of the respective academic programmes.    Critical Thinking Seminars include: Introduction to Critical Thinking (ICT), the principal offering of the Undergraduate Writing Programme (UWP). All students complete ICT in their first year (either in the Monsoon or the Spring semester). The UWP also offers ELT Tutorials, an immersion critical thinking course for non-native English speakers, which are capped at 5 students each. Other departments offer elective sequels to ICT, to further develop students’ writing and research skills.     Ashoka University requires each student to take 9 Foundation Courses. Each of these courses is mandatory. These courses are not formal gateways into the Major programmes, but distinctive courses that introduce students to the foundations of thought and various styles of thinking, and also to inter- and transdisciplinary approaches.  Other than Introduction to Critical Thinking which must be completed in the first year, students have the flexibility to choose the order in which they take the Foundation Courses but are advised to complete the Foundation Courses series early in the three year undergraduate programme.     A Major is the subject in which a student will earn a Bachelor’s degree – either a B.A. or a B.Sc. Although students can take courses toward their specialisation starting from the second semester, they are only required to formally declare their Major at the end of the third semester. A minimum of 12 courses are required to complete a Major in a subject; 16 courses are required to complete an Interdisciplinary Major.     While these are not double-degree programmes, they combine related fields and explore new approaches to the study of particular fields to give students a single, interdisciplinary Bachelors’ degree.     Students are encouraged to consider declaring a Minor in addition to their Major. To qualify for a Minor, students must take 6 courses (24 credits) in a programme outside their field of Major specialisation. For details regarding the more specific requirements students must meet (e.g. the kinds of courses students must take to qualify for a Minor), please consult the website of the respective academic programmes. In addition to the subjects listed here, we also offer Minors in all our eleven major subjects.     The Concentration will consist of four 4-credit courses (or courses totaling 16 credits) in that subject, at least two of which (or courses totaling 8 credits) must be 200-level or above.  The Concentration can be completed either by the end of the 3-year degree or during the +1 year. A Concentration can be completed in pure Major and Minor programmes.     Every semester, Ashoka University offers several 2-credit Co-curricular Courses in Performing Arts, Visual Arts, and Languages. Classes for these courses normally meet in the evenings once a week for two hours. Co-curricular Courses are a mixture of practical training in an art form (e.g. dance, theatre, music, painting, ceramics) or a language (e.g. French, Latin, Urdu) and critical analysis of the aesthetic, social, political, economic, and historical dimensions of the same. Students have to take 2 Co-curricular Courses as part of their graduation requirements; in any semester, a student can take a maximum of 1 Co-curricular Course.         Ashoka University aims to help students become well-rounded individuals who can think critically about issues from multiple perspectives, communicate effectively and become leaders with a commitment to public service. An Ashoka education carries a strong emphasis on foundational knowledge, thorough academic research based on rigorous pedagogy, and hands-on experience with real-world challenges.

Started in 2011, YIF grooms socially conscious leaders and change-makers for the 21st century. Offered as Ashoka University’s flagship residential postgraduate diploma in liberal studies, the YIF is unlike any other graduate academic programme. Fellows get access and exposure to diverse areas of study, research and practice within a year. This often helps Fellows (re)imagine themselves and discover or strengthen their passion and career trajectory. Fellows study a curated selection of courses taught by renowned educators, work on a team-based project to solve a real-world problem, and learn how to think critically and write effectively. They are also mentored by inspiring individuals, and live with a community of diverse individuals from many walks of life.     The multidimensional learning opportunities enable Fellows to build or hone 21st century skills that are in high demand, regardless of their past educational or professional backgrounds and their future goals: Collaboration, Communication, Problem-Solving, Critical Thinking, and Leadership.      Click on any of the sections below to learn about specific components of the YIF.    Faculty and Courses Peer Diversity and Learning Experiential Learning Module Critical Writing Mentorship The Crossover Series Alumni-in-Residence  Ever had an educator who profoundly influenced you? We bring together many. The Young India Fellowship attracts renowned academicians, practitioners, and experts in the field to the classroom, and gives them the autonomy to innovate, create, and craft curricula. This is a rare freedom within academia and ensures an unparalleled teaching and learning experience, not just for YIF, but across all programmes at Ashoka University. The diversity in courses is also reflected in the varied styles of teaching and assessment, which includes discussions, seminars, field visits, presentations, and group work. While catering to multiple learning styles, this allows you to learn from a range of perspectives, and prepare yourself to be a critical thinker who can connect the dots.     Challenge and enhance your understanding of the world around you. Try the YIF classroom.  Young India Fellows are a group of promising young individuals, selected through a rigorous and elaborate search for passionate achievers with a desire to bring about change. At the YIF, a gold medalist from IIT, a history major from LSR, a Kathak dancer, a banker from Goldman Sachs and a journalist from Reuters, all attend lectures together. This creates an unparalleled peer learning environment rich with multiple perspectives. From engineering to design, film to agriculture, medicine to art, and law to journalism, being amidst diverse peers will enable cross flow of ideas and learning – which will complement and challenge what you learnt in your previous experiences.   Work on a project which has real-world impact. Explore interdisciplinary collaboration. The Experiential Learning Module (ELM) is a core component of the YIF curriculum where the Fellows work in groups of five on real-world projects from diverse sectors in collaboration with organisations and institutions (Clients). The ELM compliments academic learning at the YIF by equipping Fellows with structured problem-solving techniques, while also training them in designing and implementing sustainable solutions. It helps students learn how to work collaboratively, solve complex problems with an interdisciplinary approach, and build domain knowledge.   The ability to think critically and express effectively is valuable. No matter what you do. The YIF Critical Writing Programme has few visible contextual precedents within the Indian higher education system. Acknowledging the importance of writing as central to processes of knowledge acquisition, production, and consumption, the programme has developed a pedagogy geared towards building critical reading, writing, and thinking skills to help Fellows engage with the world of ideas and enable them to develop and express their own ideas in a well-reasoned, lucid, and engaging manner. We do this by helping students innovate with genres of writing across different disciplines to develop a metacognitive awareness regarding their own reading and writing practices. These skills act as building blocks for the liberal arts education they receive at Ashoka University and enhance their abilities to navigate academic, professional, and social spheres once they graduate from the Fellowship.   Get mentored by eminent leaders and scholars of the 21st Century.  Mentorship is one of the key pillars of the YIF, where the Fellows are connected to Mentors with strong personal, academic, and professional track records who positively impact and guide their journeys during and beyond the YIF.  The fellows have the opportunity to be mentored by not only a stalwart in academia or industry, but also by an alum who shares a similar background or interest. This allows the Young India Fellows to carve out a meaningful career path over time.   Immersions with Stalwarts. Several public intellectuals, industry leaders, artists and other dignitaries visit campus over the year, to engage with and enrich Fellows through their craft, journey and more.   The Fellowship Never Ends. Several high-impact alumni visit campus over the year, to enrich and inspire Fellows through their personal, professional and/or academic journeys and areas of interest/expertise. This also serves as a way for alumni to reconnect with the Ashoka ecosystem.    The YIF programme’s residential experience gives students access to the entire Ashoka University ecosystem. Students become a part of a vibrant community and get the opportunity to engage with people and spaces beyond the YIF. The residential experience is accentuated by the multifaceted environment of the University which includes: ● World-class infrastructure and facilities ● Multiple Centres of excellence ● Comprehensive student support systems ● Fulfilling cultural and co-curricular engagement      Since 2011, over 2100 individuals from India and abroad have commenced their lifelong journeys as Young India Fellows. Fellows are equipped with perspectives, knowledge, and capabilities that help them understand the world better  and engage with their field of study or practice through a multidisciplinary approach - essential for navigating leadership challenges in the 21st century. Fellows keep coming back to the Fellowship, and contribute to shaping and nurturing it further. They continue to support and collaborate with each other and with members of the larger Ashoka ecosystem in their professional and personal pursuits, regardless of what they do.      The Career Development Office (CDO) facilitates campus placements for Ashokans and also organizes a career preparatory program. The CDO also looks for custom opportunities that match specific career interests, and often shares relevant work opportunities with the YIF alumni community as well. The YIF Class of 2022 witnessed a 100% placements season. Recruiting organisations from the previous year include: The University is a preferred destination for several leading recruiters across Consulting, BFSI, Conglomerate, IT, BPO, KPO, Research/Analytics, Social Sector, Internet, FMCG, Startup, Fintech, Pharma, Media and Advertising, Education/EdTech, and PR, and has a commitment to enhancing inclusion, diversity and social impact, and contributing to nation-building by preparing the leaders of tomorrow.

Fellows continue to make an impact across diverse spheres, whether as entrepreneurs, in the corporate world, development sector, research, journalists, policy, sports, academia or as professional artists. Members of the community continue to demonstrate a spirit of service towards the Fellowship and Ashoka.   Alumni have pursued and excelled in a diverse set of career paths. From completing further education across diverse disciplines and securing prestigious scholarships, to starting organizations and working with leading private and public sector institutions across the world, it is very likely that you will find a YIF alumnus or alumna who is pursuing a trajectory that you’d like to.                The YIF follows a holistic admissions process, which takes into account the academic and non-academic journey, personal context, interests and potential of an individual. The online application is designed to be a reflective process.     “The ELM initiated a transition for me: from being an engineer to being a passionate advocate for the environment. It helped me give structure to my interests, and I learnt what it takes to design a project from scratch. The support of my peers and professors, coupled with the learnings from courses, are key reasons for why I could ground myself in the environment sector.” Radhika Sundaresan, YIF 2015-16 Program Analyst, Global Water Practice, The World Bank Fulbright Scholar (Environmental Sciences), Yale University BTech, Amrita University  “YIF made me realize the power of networks and how they can enable one to to build institutions and materialize projects. I felt immensely supported when 128 members of the community, including faculty and founders, came together to contribute to the fundraiser for my documentary project, ‘Borderlands’. Courtesy of  the fellowship, I can receive mentorship and advice from some of the most driven and experienced people across domains.” Samarth Mahajan, YIF 2016-17 National award-winning Filmmaker BTech and MTech, IIT Kharagpur  “YIF gave me the freedom to explore a diverse set of subjects and benefit from varied viewpoints presented by my peers and professors. The Critical Writing course ended up being one of my most formative academic experiences. It was while working on my final paper for this course that I discovered where my research interests lay. I’ve since explored these interests in my MLS thesis and am hoping to carry them with me in my PhD.” Huzaafa, YIF 2016-17, MLS 2017-18 Ph.D. Candidate (Anthropology) and Knight Hennessey Scholar, Stanford University BA Sociology, Literature and Education, University of Kashmir  The best thing I found about the YIF was the diversity of peers, their stories and perspectives, and the openness with which everybody discussed ideas. We had agreements, disagreements, and we agreed to disagree. The YIF gave me a completely fresh perspective. I have also gained a lot from the YIF after graduating, through collaborations on multiple projects with other alumni.

All undergraduates graduating with Bachelor’s Degrees at the end of their third year, or who have completed by that time at least academic 92 credits of their degree programme, are eligible for admission into the Postgraduate Diploma in Advanced Studies and Research programme, also known as the Ashoka Scholars Programme (ASP). Students who need to complete up to 8 credits of their undergraduate degree must do so within the first semester of the ASP. All students who fall into either of these categories must formally apply for admission to the ASP towards the end of the Spring semester of their third year. The exact date will be circulated by the OAA.  Students who graduate with a Bachelor’s degree after more than 3 years (late graduates) and students who have taken a break of up to one year after their UG graduation (gap students) are also eligible to apply for the ASP, provided the following condition is met: at the beginning of the Monsoon semester of the ASP, the start of their UG studies cannot be longer ago than 5 years. This is to secure compliance with UGC Guidelines, according to which UG+ASP must be completed in no more than 6 years.  Such students must submit a formal application to the OAA, comprising a statement of interest in joining the ASP supplemented by faculty and/or departmental references in support of their application. These applications will be decided on by a committee that will seek input from various stakeholders and provide students with a final decision on their application.    The ASP offers students a defining liberal arts experience that blends academic rigour with a wide range of elective options across a variety of subjects.  These options include: Completing an Advanced Major  Converting a Minor or previously taken elective courses into a Second Major Equivalent Converting a Major into an Interdisciplinary Second Major Equivalent Completing an Independent Capstone Project  Completing a Minor  Completing a Concentration  Undertaking the Ashoka Quest, a year-long social internship programme [currently on hold] Taking any courses they wish, without completing any of the above options     All ASP students, by completing the Postgraduate Diploma in Advanced Studies and Research, will become eligible to apply for postgraduate programmes in North America and other parts of the world that require 12 years of study at the secondary school level and 4 years of study at the university level. A total of 32 credits is required to graduate from the ASP with a Postgraduate Diploma in Advanced Studies and Research. Students can complete up to 2×22 = 44 credits during their ASP year, up to 52 credits if they also take two courses in the summer preceding the ASP year. Credits, if any, that are used to complete undergraduate requirements do not count towards the 32 credit minimum requirement. Students must in any event take enough courses during their ASP year that they can meet the 32 credit requirement. Typically, this means that they will take between 16 and 22 (max.) credits per semester. If students take summer courses that count towards the ASP or decide to take more courses in the Spring and fewer in the Monsoon, they may do so as long as they adhere to 2) and to the minimum credit requirement of 12 credits per semester. For students who are trying to complete their undergraduate degree requirements (up to 8 academic credits), a maximum of 6 courses will be allowed in the first semester of the ASP if required. ASP students are eligible to take any undergraduate course offered at Ashoka University for which they have fulfilled the prerequisite(s). Students can also take 4000 level seminars where these are offered. If students opt to pursue specific credentials, such as e.g. a Minor or Concentration, wish to convert a Minor into the equivalent of a second Major, pursue an Advanced Major, etc. they will take courses as per the requirements of the specific programme. The specific requirements for each of the options are spelled out below.   The exact design of the Advanced Major credential is determined by individual departments as per their specific requirements, within a credit bracket of minimally 16 and maximally 24 credits. In many departments, pursuing an Advanced Major will require the completion of a Capstone Thesis project, which will typically involve a Capstone Research Seminar and a Capstone Thesis Seminar. However, not every department will require a Capstone Thesis as an element of the Advanced Major and among those that do, the requirements and credits associated with it will be department-specific. Accordingly, interested students are advised to consult the website of the respective department or contact a department representative for details and further clarification.     ASP students can complete an Ashoka University-approved Second Major Equivalent (SME) by taking the required number of courses in any given Major programme. Courses taken in the SME subject during a student’s Bachelor’s Degree will be credited toward the SME that appears on the student’s PG Diploma transcript. A SME can also grow out of an Interdisciplinary Major completed as the student’s Bachelor’s degree, e.g. if the student completes the relevant courses in any of the components of their Interdisciplinary Major that are missing towards meeting the respective Major requirement. Normally, SMEs will require ASP students to take at least six and no more than ten courses in the SME subject during the PG Diploma year. Provided the respective department allows it, students may also complete a Capstone Thesis project in their SME subject to meet their course requirements.   Students can use the ASP to convert a UG Major into an Interdisciplinary Major Equivalent by taking the remaining courses towards the Interdisciplinary Major. Students interested in this option should plan ahead and are in any case advised to consult with the relevant departments to find out about the specific requirements and whether and how they need to take courses in such a way that they can meet these requirements.   Provided they find an advisor who is able and willing to supervise it, students can pursue an Independent Capstone project in any of Ashoka University’s approved (Pure) Major or Minor Programmes. This gives students inter alia the opportunity to carry out a substantial thesis project even in areas that do not offer a Major or an Advanced Major.       ASP students can complete an Ashoka University-approved Minor by taking six approved courses in any given Major or Minor programme. Departments may have specific requirements as to which courses a student pursuing a Minor must take and students are advised to consult the respective departmental website for details. Courses taken in the Minor subject during the student’s Bachelor’s Degree will be credited toward the Minor that appears on the student’s PG Diploma transcript. Normally, completing a Minor will require ASP students to take at least one and no more than six courses in the Minor subject during the PG Diploma year.   ASP students can complete an Ashoka University-approved Concentration by taking four approved courses in any given Major or Minor programme, including approved multidisciplinary subjects that are not represented by Major and Minor programmes (e.g. a Concentration in Legal Studies). Courses taken in the Concentration subject during a student’s Bachelor’s Degree will be credited toward the Concentration that appears on the student’s PG Diploma transcript. Normally Concentrations will require ASP students to take at least one and no more than four courses in the Minor subject during the PG Diploma year.   Currently, the Ashoka Quest rests. Once this changes, this section will be updated accordingly.   The ASP can be used as a year in which students take a variety of courses in different areas to increase the breadth of their exposure to the various liberal arts and science programmes offered at Ashoka. This can be an exciting opportunity for students who want to broaden their horizon or who wish to acquire an individual academic skill-set. For further questions please contact the Office of Academic Affairs at:          Ashoka University had originally designed its UG programme as a 4-year degree and thus we believe that the 4-year undergraduate experience transforms students into an Ashoka liberal arts honours student. It helps them to be academically well-rounded and socially engaged. It makes them better prepared for the job market and also for postgraduate study. In addition, students who want to pursue a Masters or a PhD degree in the US or Canada will need an equivalent of a four-year undergraduate degree. Therefore all students who are considering a Masters /PhD. Degree abroad should definitely do the 4th year.   Students can do a variety of courses, research, and academic writing and social experiential projects in the fourth year: Completing an Advanced Major Complete an Interdisciplinary Second Major Equivalent Completing an Independent Capstone project Starting and/or Completing a Minor Completing a Concentration Converting a Minor, previously taken elective courses, or part of an Interdisciplinary Major into a Second Major Equivalent Taking any courses they wish, without completing any of the above options    All Ashoka students graduating with Bachelor’s Degrees at the end of their third year, or who have completed at least 92 credits by that time of their degree programme, are eligible for admission into the Postgraduate Diploma in Advanced Studies and Research programme, also known as the Ashoka Scholars Programme (ASP) Please note: In order to complete the Bachelor’s Degree, students need 100 credits but they are eligible for ASP with 92 academic credits. Students who need to complete up to 8 academic credits of their undergraduate degree must do so in Semester 1 of ASP (Monsoon Semester). In case of students trying to complete their undergraduate degree requirements, a maximum of 6 courses will be allowed in semester 1.   Students who graduate with a Bachelor’s degree after more than 3 years (late graduates) and students who have taken a break of up to one year after their UG graduation (gap students) are also eligible to apply for the ASP, provided the following condition is met: at the beginning of the Monsoon semester of the ASP, the start of their UG studies cannot be longer ago than 5 years. This is to secure compliance with UGC Guidelines, according to which UG+ASP must be completed in no more than 6 years.   The UGC demands that we offer undergraduate degrees that can be completed in three years. This is why Major Courses, Foundation Courses (including the ICT), and Co-Curricular Courses have to be completed by the end of three years. However, Ashoka University has always conceived of its undergraduate programme as a 4-year experience and therefore the University offers another year, the ASP year, which will be the crowning year of a liberal arts education.   The Financial Aid status for Ashoka students remains unchanged for the ASP. The Financial Aid awarded to them for their UG studies will continue at the same level for the fourth year. Only students who start the ASP after a gap may need to get reevaluated for Financial Aid.   ASP is open to graduates of the 3 year B.A. / B. Sc. programmes at Ashoka University. Students must formally apply through the registration portal of the University.   Students will get a Post Graduate Diploma at the end of the one year. There will be a formal graduation ceremony along with the University’s annual Convocation.   Ashoka University will treat all the graduating students of the ASP programme as alums who will be assisted by the Career Development Office (CDO) in their job search.

They may then take the remaining Foundation Course later. In their second semester, students take at least two Foundation Courses of which one may be Introduction to Critical Thinking if not taken in the first semester. Students may take as many Foundation Courses as they can before declaring a Major. There is no specific order in which students have to take the Foundation Courses. *Note that depending on the faculty member teaching the course, the emphasis may vary across courses offered. While the basic understand remains the same, themes and texts will vary within the same Foundation Course. For example, with three faculty members offering the Great Books course in the same semester, the chosen books and fragments of books as well as the themes explored will vary from faculty member to faculty member.

This programme’s interdisciplinary module contains coursework from a variety of disciplines, including Humanities, Social Sciences, Behavioural Sciences, and Natural Sciences. The University aims to train students to think critically about their disciplines of interest while deriving insights from other disciplines. The MA programme in Liberal Studies also helps students to prepare for their graduate applications. Prospective students have the unique opportunity of designing their own curriculum, in consultation with their supervisor, and often choose to work on projects across two or more disciplines. The programme’s sole focus is on nurturing curiosity for intellectual challenges and building skills for research. Additionally, students are required to work on a research-intensive capstone project, which is expected to culminate in a traditional Master’s’ thesis or a creative project like a novel or a film.    Admissions for the Master’s in Liberal Arts programme is currently restricted to graduates of the Young India Fellowship. This is a degree programme taken by students who have graduated with a diploma in Liberal Studies from the Young India Fellowship, and have been accepted by an Ashoka University faculty to work on a specific research project as a graduate assistant.   Since 2015, MLS students have worked on a vast array of disciplines, covering human-computer interaction, cognitive Psychology, Literary Theory, Macroeconomics, Anthropology, Gender Studies, Politics and Sociology and Philosophy. Their research topics have included: The politics of Zilla Parishads in Western Uttar Pradesh, Understanding Human Memory and Aging using Email Archives, The Amplification of Group Emotions, The psychological impact of communal violence, Religious Conversions and Law in India, The development of female wrestling in Haryana, A History of the 1946 Bombay Navy mutiny, The foreign policy thoughts of prominent Hindu nationalists, an Ethnography of a Kashmiri political party, an Ethnography of the student movement in Ramjas College, a Content analysis of Parliamentary questions, among others. Five former MLS students are currently pursuing their PhD in Psychology (University of Austin, Washington University, Saint-Louis and University of Maryland), in Political Science (UC Santa Barbara), in Social anthropology (University of Edinburgh). Other graduates of the MLS have gone to the Netherlands for further Studies, are teaching law in India, or work as teaching fellows and research assistants at Ashoka University and IIIT-Delhi. Others have started their own ventures or have joined the private sector.          The courses that I studied with the English Department at Ashoka University contributed immensely to my understanding of the various debates in English Literature and Criticism. The lectures were exciting and the professors were compassionate. My experience with Prof. Kothari’s course, Translation Theories and Multilingual Contexts, was one of the most memorable learning experiences of my life! Not only were there great courses on offer at the department, there was also an exceptional support system for students writing their dissertations. The English Department at Ashoka approaches the study of literature as a collaborative activity. This spirit of collaboration carries forward into the professional lives of every student who has spent time at the department. All in all, the English Department at Ashoka catered to every need that a budding scholar of literature might have. Salik Basharat MLS 2021    I’ve had the good fortune of being associated with the Philosophy Department at Ashoka University as a student as well as a teacher and my experience on both sides has been only exceptional. As a student I had the opportunity to study under what is undoubtedly the best faculty in Philosophy in the country and their consistent, unfailing support at each step. As a TA (for Metaphysics) and a Teaching Fellow (for Environmental Ethics, Indian Civilisations, Mind and Behaviour, Existentialism, Philosophy of Love, also for Morality and the Good Life (YIF) and Love and Friendship (YIF)), I had the complete guidance of all my professors, and a wonderfully curious and excited bunch of students. The department is extremely active—there are always events to attend or classes to sit in on. In September 2021, I will be heading to Simon Fraser University to pursue a fully funded two-year Masters in Philosophy, especially designed for those wanting to move into doctoral studies in philosophy. The MLS and the teaching opportunities thereafter have been monumental in allowing me to make this shift from my undergraduate discipline – i.e.,  History – to Philosophy at the graduate level, and have helped me secure admission into a fantastic programme such as the one at SFU. I could not possibly have asked for a more stimulating and supportive environment to nurture my academic interests.

Our approach to Economics is a comprehensive one. We believe in teaching students both how to ask and address questions that are informed by economic theory as well as how to substantiate their arguments with rigorous data analysis. The coursework in the programme has been designed with the latest research in mind and draws on some of today’s most exciting research fields. At the end of the programme, students are expected to have state-of-the-art quantitative skills valued both in academia and in the corporate world. Ashoka’s intellectually vibrant campus provides students an opportunity to engage in cross-disciplinary learning and be informed by the views of leading political scientists, sociologists, psychologists, historians, mathematicians and computer scientists, amongst others. The campus is an ideal space where students can grow—intellectually as well as professionally. Within a very short period, Ashoka has been recognized as a leading innovator in Indian higher education. The Master’s programme in Economics provides students an opportunity to leverage Ashoka’s growing stature and expanding networks to shape their future careers, whether it be in academia or beyond.   The Ashoka approach to Economics is fundamentally about bringing together cutting-edge economic theory and rigorous data analysis to address questions at the frontiers of research. The Masters Programme in Economics has been developed with this perspective. It will provide students not only the opportunity to be trained by highly qualified economists but also to leverage Ashoka’s growing stature and expanding networks to shape their careers, whether it be in the academy or beyond. The Master of Arts in Economics programme is a two-year, four-semester programme. Students will study 7 compulsory courses and an elective in the first year and at least 8 electives (or its equivalent) in the second year. Before the beginning of the first semester, students will attend a mandatory Math Camp to brush up their quantitative skills. In the first year, students grow deep roots in the foundations of modern economics as they are provided with a rigorous introduction to microeconomics, macroeconomics and econometrics. In addition, they take a course which advances their understanding of quantitative techniques. This rigorous training prepares them for the more research-focused and specialised elective courses that they have to choose from in the second semester and later in their second year. The goal of these courses is to allow the students to develop an appreciation of what the current research frontier in economics looks like.    The course across the two years are: Math Camp is for 2 credits, while all remaining courses are for 4 credits. In the first year, students are introduced to the foundations of modern economics through rigorous coursework in microeconomics, macroeconomics and econometrics. In their second semester and over the second year, students pursue their academic interests across various sub-disciplines in economics using both theoretical, and empirical research methods.     The first batch of MA Economics students graduated in 2019. Since then, our students have been placed in several corporate and research firms. Many have gone on to pursue higher academic degrees as well.    MA Economics Academic Handbook      Ashoka University aims to help students become well-rounded individuals who can think critically about issues from multiple perspectives, communicate effectively and become leaders with a commitment to public service. An Ashoka education carries a strong emphasis on foundational knowledge, thorough academic research based on rigorous pedagogy, and hands-on experience with real-world challenges.     The MA Economics programme at Ashoka University was a truly transformational experience. The rigorous coursework, outstanding faculty and regular department seminars, broadened my understanding and appreciation of economics and its applications in the real-world. The small class size and close-knit community fostered a rich learning experience and enabled me to develop lasting relationships with both my batch-mates as well as professors. Today, I find that the key skills that have helped me in my current role, were in fact ones that I had honed during my two years at Ashoka, such as dealing with ambiguity through structured problem solving, working in diverse teams and under tight deadlines, and communicating in a coherent manner. Moreover, since graduating, the broader Ashoka alumni network has been really helpful from both a personal and professional standpoint, with its active, engaging and supportive community.

Students will master a set of tools that will enable them to think critically and contribute to debates on a wide array of interesting problems and issues of public policy. Although the primary focus of study will be on economics, students will be exposed to ideas and techniques from many other disciplines through the Foundation courses in other disciplines such as History, Sociology, Literature, and Politics. Students will also be taught the quantitative techniques in Mathematics and Statistics that have become an integral part of modern economic analysis. We are confident that students will imbibe the skills necessary to enter a wide range of careers. Some will go on to further studies in Economics. Some others may wish to work as professional economists in the private or the public sector. The department recommends that students complete mathematics in Classes 11 and 12 to be eligible for any economics-related major or minor. This includes the pure Economics major and the three Interdisciplinary majors of Economics and Finance; Politics, Philosophy, and Economics; and Economics and History.Students meeting this requirement are automatically eligible for all economics-related majors or minors. For students who have not studied mathematics in Classes 11 and 12 to be eligible for any economics-related major or minor, they need to: a) Take MAT 1000: Calculus (a 1000-level course) offered by the Mathematics department in their first semester and b) Secure at least an A- to be eligible   Ashoka University’s Economics programs are taught by faculty members who hold expertise in Game Theory, Behavioural Economics, Experimental Economics, Macroeconomics, Microeconomics and much more. The faculty combines superb teaching with focused research.     The total number of minimum credits required by students to graduate with an Economics major is 100 credits. Credit requirements for interdisciplinary majors are listed below. Cohort of 2020-23 Onwards: Foundation Courses: one must take eight (8) foundation courses and one (1) ICT. Compulsory courses in Economics: these include nine (9) courses — Introduction to Economics, Mathematics for Economics, Microeconomic Theory I, Macroeconomic Theory I, Statistics for Economics, Microeconomic Theory II, Macroeconomic Theory II, Econometrics, and Development Economics. Elective courses in Economics: one must take six (6) elective courses in Economics from a set of courses to be offered in the 5th and the 6th semesters.

Students can specialize in financial, managerial, international, industrial or other areas of economics.     Yes, your degree will display the major and the minor you’ve completed.    Economics and Finance requires 19 courses – it is an academically demanding major and will take up a large portion of your time at Ashoka. Three years at Ashoka give you space for 29 courses (excluding co-curriculars), of which (19 + 9 FCs) 28 slots will be accounted for. The pure Economics major requires 15 courses. With FCs, 24 out of 29 courses are accounted for. Beyond that, extra courses will need to be accommodated in summer semesters (a maximum of 2 courses per summer sem) and in the fourth year. In order to complete Eco-Fin and one (or two) minors or concentrations will need careful planning depending on the requirements of all the departments and will definitely require you to take summer semesters and a possible fourth year. The fourth year, without the Advanced Major, also allows a maximum of 22 credits per semester – this will amount to 5 4-credit courses per semester and a co-curricular/TAship/2-credit course. For help planning out your schedules, feel free to reach out to the relevant student reps.   Most mandatory courses are only offered in certain semesters and must be taken in a sequential order. Hence one might need to take 2 courses in one semester to finish a minor.    The courses for the major and minor are the same, and are taken by the same Professor. There is no difference in the content, only the number of courses.    A minor consists of 6 courses, while a concentration consists of 4 courses. Which one you prefer depends on the depth you’re looking to achieve in any field – it’s a personal preference. There is no limit to the number of minors/concentrations you can complete, but the demands of the Eco-Fin major are rigorous and it will likely be difficult to find space in your schedule to accommodate more than one minor/concentration.   Completing a minor, along with the Economics major, is possible in three years. Summer semesters will likely be required in order to accommodate all courses.    Yes, you can. The course requirements of both your subjects will help you plan out your schedule for the three years. It is advisable to start thinking about a minor early on in order to accommodate all courses, given the sequential nature of the Economics program.    It is not possible to do a thesis with a minor. You may be able to do an ISM, given that you can find a professor to advise you.   The choice between a summer semester and an internship is completely dependent on your interests. The balance between work experience and additional coursework will depend on what your future plans are.    Foundational courses offered by the Economics department are typically not math intensive. They do not require students to have taken Maths at a higher secondary school level.    Two co-curricular courses do not come under the Economics program, but are a part of the university’s degree requirements. To graduate with a UG degree in three years, a minimum of two co-curriculars need to be completed.    Yes, math in 11th and 12th is required for any program in Economics.   The specific programming language covered will depend on the faculty. There is an emphasis on STATA in the Econometrics course. R may be taught by some professors. A few elective courses introduce you to MATLAB and the software zTRee as well.    The department has a flexible course cap policy which can be changed on the basis of the number of registered students, thus ensuring that every interested student is accommodated. Even if the course cap is reached, if there is a student who needs to do a particular course in order to meet their graduation requirements, they will be manually added to the class. We request you to get in touch with the OAA and the HoD in this regard.    Maths for Economics is a specialised course that deals specifically with the mathematical concepts required for Economists. While taking this course would ensure that you are up to date with all the math that one might need for an Economics major, one may also choose to take more general calculus/linear algebra courses offered by the Maths department if one feels it might be beneficial.   Course caps depend on the course type, the Professor offering that course, and the number of interested students taking that particular course. Introductory level courses typically have a higher cap than electives. However, all course caps are flexible.    The course limit for a semester is 5 courses + a co-curricular (6 in total). Economics at Ashoka is an academically intensive course and most students do end up taking 5 courses along with one co-curricular course in at least one semester during their program. It is recommended that you finish your co-curriculars early so that you can devote time to academics in your third year.    The Economics major is one of the more rigorous programs offered at Ashoka. One of the reasons for that is that it has 15 required courses, versus the standard 12. It might require you to take 5 courses in multiple semesters, which can be academically challenging. But connecting with your professors and forming study groups with classmates can make the load much easier to handle.    Students having completed certain calculus courses from the Math department may be allowed to substitute them for Maths for Economics. Similarly, doing MAT201: Probability and Statistics and MAT311: Statistical Inference substitutes for Statistics for Economics. However before taking any of these courses, it is necessary to inform and seek permission from the HoD.     No, a PPE with a specialisation in Economics and a pure Economics degree are fundamentally different and may not receive equal weightage.    Different PPE tracks have different numbers of courses. A PPE major must do a minimum of 4 courses in each of the disciplines i.e. politics, philosophy and economics, and can do a maximum of 8 in any one discipline. From the perspective of the Economics department, students may choose to do 4, 5, 6, 7 or 8 courses in Economics depending upon their interests. Depending on which track you choose, the courses may be more theory-intensive or quantitative.    Students may and do choose to take a summer or semester abroad in a variety of universities across the world. Given the rigid structure of the program, the courses to be taken abroad will need to be in sync with the ones required by the department. Before planning, it is necessary to get a clearance from the department (UG coordinator and HOD) with the course description and other relevant information of the intended course.    An Economics major can find employment in a wide variety of fields, including but not limited to research, consultancy, NGO work, policy, banking etc.    The core courses (9 in total) are mandatory and 8 of them are required to be completed in the first two years. The 9th core course, Development Economics, and the 6 Elective courses are to be taken in the third year. The core courses lay a foundation for the study of Economics, while the electives deep-dive into specific areas of research in the field.    On the basis of one’s interests and the availability of the course. It is recommended, at an undergraduate level, to have a mix of Micro and Macro based elective courses instead of specialising in one subfield.    Yes, some Economics courses are cross-listed with Environment Studies. Courses offered by other departments may also be cross-listed with Economics in the future. Please refer to the course list shared by your student representatives for more details on the same.    You can take a maximum of two cross-listed courses.    It is not mandatory for prospective economics majors at Ashoka to take Calculus in their first semester. The department does not have a policy on the course and does not make any formal recommendations. However, if students feel that the course will be beneficial to them outside of the Eco/Fin program at Ashoka, they are welcome to take it. The recommended/required undergraduate courses for a Master’s in Economics differ by university.

Courses for Biology majors will provide a strong foundation for research and careers in the biological sciences, medicine, pharmaceutical and biotech industry, teaching, and other related fields.   Ashoka was established as a liberal arts research university. Students of Ashoka start querying the growth of human thought, origin, and growth of human civilization in general, Indian civilization in particular. They are introduced to the origin of scientific inquiry and the relationship and inter-dependence between science and other domains of human creativity and critical thinking. On this foundation, fundamental principles of physics are taught to all students, in a way that brings in both the elegance of principles of natural world and the complexity that is still needs to be unraveled. Subsequently, students are introduced to chemical, biological, and human worlds, not as independent disciplines, but as a continuum of the physical world. Mathematics would be taught as a language that connects all these disciplines of science and also as an abstract method by which we understand our surroundings. Our model of education is concept-based and inquiry-driven, as opposed to the more traditional content-based models. Faculty at Ashoka pursue research in those areas that are related to the topics they teach undergraduate students. The vision is to integrate research and teaching at all levels of science education. Sciences at Ashoka will be rooted in experiments, but these will not take the rigid “objectives, apparatus, method, conclusion” form. Students learn both through taught courses in the classrooms, employing experimental methods in labs, and involved in research with faculty. Students are also exposed to frontiers of science through seminars, symposia, and national and international conferences that are routinely organized on the campus of Ashoka. The undergraduate program in Biology is targeted at students, who have strong interests in Biology (Biology Major) as well as those who are interested in learning more about Biology or for meeting their scientific temperament needs (Biology Minor). Courses are taught keeping in mind those students may or may not have a prior introduction to basic concepts of Biology. Courses for Biology majors will provide a strong foundation for research and as well as for careers in the biological sciences, medicine, pharmaceutical and biotech industry, teaching, and other related fields. A prospective Biology major student is required to complete 10 core courses in Biology and suggested optional courses in Science and Biology along with the mandatory requirement of 9 foundation courses.For detailed information about the department, teaching programs, and course information, please check our Department’s Handbook.    Biology major students are required to complete 7 core courses, 4 lab courses and 4 of the several optional courses with the mandatory 7 foundation courses. For details about the courses and the program, please consult the Department of Biology handbook.   To pursue a minor in Biology at Ashoka, one must complete 6 courses that are either offered by or cross-listed with the Biology department. This includes 4 core theory courses, no lab courses and 2 electives.

Requirements: Students are expected to take 14 courses to earn their major in Chemistry. Of these, the course break-up is as follows: Gateway Courses 7 Core Courses 4 Lab Courses 3 Electives Up to 3 cross-listed courses from another department can count towards the major. *The Critical Thinking Seminar is a mandatory requirement for batches from the Undergraduate Batch of 2023. Previous batches can count a CTS towards their requirements, but they are not required to do so. Instead, they can fulfill their requirements by taking another 1000/2000-level elective.   Students from different department are always encouraged to take chemistry as their minor. The knowledge will help a student to understand the science in our everyday life. This will also help to become a better researcher in any field of science. We believe it’s a great opportunity for a liberal university student. Requirements: To complete a minor in Chemistry, a student must do 6 courses: This can include direct course offered from chemistry department or cross-listed (if any) with the department. 4 theory courses and any 2 electives can be chosen to complete a minor in Chemistry. Lab courses can be also considered as a minor subject.

Hear from Prof. Sourav Pal, Visiting Professor of Chemistry, and Isha Singhal, Chemistry Major (Batch of 22) on the unique ways in which Chemistry is taught at Ashoka. At Ashoka, our objective is to teach Chemistry in an integrative and holistic manner connecting with other branches of science such as physics, biology, and material chemistry. The main aim of the department is to integrate interdisciplinary research with teaching.         No, it’s a core course. Any Minor also can take lab course.   All labs are stand-alone courses and mandatory for Chemistry major students. They each count for the same number of credits as theory courses.   Only for ASP students.   Yes. But it is recommended that you stay for a 4th year.   We haven’t decided about TA in Chemistry course.   Yes. But prior to take the courses please contact with the respective professors or HOD Prof. Sourav Pal.   Has not been decided yet.   Electives are offered at 300 level. You can choose to do any 3 for a major and 2 for a minor and 1 for concentration. There is no minimum limit.   As of now, the Chemistry department is not offering any cross listed subjects. For future information please talk to Prof. Sourav Pal or Dr. Munmun Ghosh.    We are investing in the idea of the 4th year as a time when undergraduates delve into research in a serious year-long way. In addition, there are several summer opportunities for science and undergraduates can approach labs of their interest in Ashoka in order to start doing research whenever they would like as their undergraduate degree progresses. We encourage students to take small projects with the professors in any time of the year.   We are interested in specializing in various areas of Chemistry as well as some interface area with biology and chemistry. Material science, Inorganic chemistry, Bioinorganic chemistry, computational chemistry are the few such mentioned fields, chemistry department are offering for research.   The 3-year degree you get if you specialize in Chemistry would be a B.Sc. However, the additional qualification you get for the fourth year would be named as per the norms of the State Government.

These programmes are designed  to acquaint a student with literature and literary methods across genres, cultures, and languages. Students master interpretation and analysis skills, learning to formulate robust and original arguments both in writing and speaking.   Students can pursue a pure English major or one of many interdisciplinary English majors; they can also pursue a minor or a concentration in English. The department offers a wide selection of courses, which are divided into 4 categories: 1. 1000-levels: These are general English courses that any student at Ashoka can take. They also count as electives for students majoring or minoring in English. 2. 2000-levels: These courses are introductory courses to various fields and methodologies of literary study. Although they are aimed at English students specifically, they can be taken by all Ashoka students. 3. 3000-levels: These courses are specialist courses designed for English majors and minors. Only students who have taken the gateways can take these courses. 4. 4000-levels: The 4000-level Graduate Seminars are reserved for ASP, MA, MLS students (with an English concentration), and PhD students. With the permission of the instructor, a third-year student can take a maximum of one 4000-level course towards their major.    The pure major in English offers students an in-depth, expansive study of literature: courses cover a diverse range of texts from across the world, thinking through classic and unusual questions and themes. Students are expected to take 12 courses to earn their major in English. Of these, the course break-up is as follows: 2 Gateways Forms of Literature Introduction to Literary Theory 4 Survey Courses Early British Literature Indian Literatures Literature in the Age of Empire Postcolonial Literature 6 Electives: 1 Critical Thinking Seminar* 1 1000/2000-level courses** 3 3000-level courses 1 1000/2000/3000-level elective Up to 3 cross-listed courses from another department can count towards the major. *The Critical Thinking Seminar is a mandatory requirement for batches from the incoming Undergraduate Batch of 2023. Previous batches can count a CTS towards their requirements, but they are not required to do so. Instead, they can fulfill their requirements by taking another 1000/2000-level elective. **English majors can take a maximum of ONE approved language course in an approved language (Sanskrit, Persian, Greek, Latin, Old English) instead of one of their required 1000/2000-level electives. Ideally, an English major’s timetable—solely with regard to their English requirements (excluding any FC, CT and CC requirements)—should look like this:   Semester 1 Semester 2 Semester 3 Semester 4 Semester 5 Semester 6  Forms of Literature Literary Theory   Early British Literature Literature in the Age of Empire Indian            Literatures Postcolonial Literatures  6 electives, distributed as per the student’s preference  While sticking to this timetable is encouraged for the sake of better management and smooth completion of an English degree, Ashoka’s flexible academic structure ensures alternate organizations. Ultimately, it is up to the students how they wish to engineer their academic years. The overall credit requirement to graduate with an English major is 100 credits. These come from the English courses, FCs, ICT, CCs, and other courses.   The minor in English offers a thorough grounding in core literature courses, while granting students the opportunity to pursue fields of their own interest. To complete a minor in English, a student must do 6 courses: 2 Gateways Forms of Literature Introduction to Literary Theory 2 of 4 Survey Courses Early British Literature Indian Literatures Literature in the Age of Empire Postcolonial Literature 2 Electives: 1 1000/2000-level elective 1 3000-level elective Up to 2 cross-listed courses from another department can count towards the minor. Postcolonial Literatures, although a 3000-level survey course, will not count towards fulfilling the three 3000-level elective requirements.   The English department at Ashoka offers three interdisciplinary majors: English and Creative Writing, English and Media Studies, and English and Performing Arts. Students are required to take 16 courses across both the disciplines to earn their interdisciplinary major. Along with their discipline specific courses, students need to take their required FCs, ICT, CCs and other courses to fulfill their overall credit requirement of 116 credits to graduate with an interdisciplinary major.   The concentration in English is for students who are invested in exploring limited, but varied, English courses. To complete a concentration in English, a student must do 4 courses: 1 of 2 Gateway Courses: Forms of Literature or Introduction to Literary Theory Any 3 English courses These 3 courses can include one of the other gateways, any of the survey courses, and the electives. However, students can only take 3000-level electives if they have taken Introduction to Literary Theory. Up to 1 cross-listed course from another department can count towards the concentration.    Department of English Handbook      Ashoka University’s Department of English offers an assortment of undergraduate programmes which prepare students for careers in Higher Education, Law, Journalism, Advertising and related fields.

A historian combines the skills of a detective, a scavenger, a judge and a ventriloquist. S/he is an artist and a skilled craftsperson who spins and weaves narratives of the past. Historical creativity lies in gathering, wrestling with, and connecting the traces of the past to construct a rich tapestry of human lives, emotions, and ideas. These traces come in various garbs – gravestones, burial sites, forgotten cities, mudpots, musical notes, folklores, war songs, memoirs, archival records, speeches, letters, newspapers, cartoons, cave art, paintings, architecture, clothes, food, chronicles, cinema, advertisements – all and any remnant of human existence. A historian’s ability to make effective use of these materials requires inculcation of two core ideas: empathy and imagination. Empathy fuels and glues our connection with other humans. It helps us recognize others’ perceptions, feelings and ways of being. Empathy is a vital tool of a historian because it obligates a historian to question and challenge a single conception of the world in order to access other worlds and other lives. Thus the spirit of questioning and the consciousness of one’s own frames of reference is the starting point of historical inquiry. The second feature of imagination is the creative faculty which enables us to form images and feelings that ordinary senses cannot perceive. It is a critical instrument for a historian who studies worlds that are removed both in time and space from his or her own. Conjuring up those historical worlds requires a leap of imagination, a willing suspension of disbelief and a readiness to encounter the unknown.   The Department of History has crafted an undergraduate curriculum which contains lessons about forgotten cities, folklores, speeches, letters, architecture, clothes, food, cinema, paintings and much more. The Department has its strengths in the history of ancient India, with a special focus on archaeology, heritage, society, politics, religion, and ideas; the history of medieval and early modern India with an emphasis on states, empires, and warfare; the history of modern India and the Indian Ocean with a focus on political violence, space, environment; contemporary history and international history of modern South Asia; and global history.    A Major is the field of a student’s primary academic focus in course of their undergraduate degree. For a Major in History, students must take a total of 12 courses in History. History majors must take all 5 gateway courses (HIS 1001, HIS 2001, HIS 2002, HIS 2003, and HIS 2004). These five gateway courses give students a solid foundation in the history of the  general patterns and processes of Indian and modern Western history within a global comparative framework. These courses provide students with chronological anchors for more advanced thematic courses. Along with the gateways, 2 reading courses, (HIS-3001 and HIS-3002) equip students with the basic apparatus of the historical craft. Reading History introduces students to different theories that have influenced historical imagination, the various schools of thought and modes of writing history such as positivism, Marxism, annals, structuralism, post-structuralism, postmodernism and postcolonialism. Reading Archaeology introduces students to the methods and theories of archaeology globally, and engages students with the history of archaeological thought.   A Minor is a secondary area of study that a student can choose to focus in course of their undergraduate degree. Students Minoring in History must take 6 total courses in History. These are: any 2 of the five Gateway Courses (HIS 1001, HIS 2001, HIS 2002, HIS 2003, and HIS 2004) any 1 of the two Reading Courses (HIS 3001, HIS 3002) 3 additional History courses, which may be any combination of Gateway Courses, Electives, Independent Study Modules (ISM), CTS, and/or the UG Research Thesis/Project.   Note: No more than one CTS can count towards a Minor in History.    A prospective History interdisciplinary major student must complete 16 or 17 courses, depending on the interdisciplinary major. The Department of History currently offers 2 interdisciplinary majors in History: History and International Relations  History and Economics    A Concentration is a field of a student’s secondary academic interest aside from their Major (and Minor) in course of their undergraduation. For a Concentration in History, students must take 4 total courses in History. These are: HIS 3001. Reading History 3 additional History courses, which may be any combination of Gateway Courses, Electives, Independent Study Modules (ISM), CTS, and/or the UG Research Thesis/Project.  Note: No more than one CTS can count towards a Concentration in History.      Department of History Handbook      Ashoka University’s Department of History offers undergraduate programmes which hone a student’s historical imagination through conceptual, historiographical and methodological study of different themes. The history faculty represents a broad swath of expertise, across time periods, movements, cultures and continents.     I think for my part, studying history at Ashoka University has been both invigorating as well as eye-opening. Ashoka with its liberal arts setup allows you to play with courses outside the department and experiment. Courses offered by other departments but cross-listed with History can add up to the History Major. The courses in the History department allow one to go into the nuances so that we learn how interesting and layered the field of History is. Professors have always been open and welcoming and the freedom in course structure allows you to explore other departments while pursuing a Major in the History department.

The wide applicability of these ideas and their deep connection with the natural sciences have made this discipline one of the most fruitful arenas of human inquiry. Combining, as it does, the greatest creative freedom with the most stringent standards of rigor, Mathematics also happens to be the ideal training ground for learning a broad range of analytical and problem-solving skills. Ashoka University’s Mathematics major program has been designed to meet two primary goals: Students should get a broad exposure to the primary areas and the central ideas of contemporary Mathematics (as well as their applications) and Students should develop rigorous, analytical reasoning skills, along with problem-solving ability. In addition to the Foundation courses that are common across disciplines, students aiming to choose Mathematics as their major should take the enabling course on Calculus as early as possible. This will be followed by 11 required and 3 elective courses in Mathematics. The required courses cover the areas of Analysis, Algebra, Linear Algebra, Probability, and Differential Equations. Elective courses vary from semester to semester depending on student and faculty interests. In addition, students have the opportunity to study some special topics in depth under the guidance of a faculty member. At the end of the program of study, we expect students to be able to read and understand mathematical proofs; learn and apply new mathematical concepts; and, construct and communicate a correct and rigorous argument on their own. Most importantly, we expect students to be able to solve new mathematical problems on their own. Students completing this program will be well prepared to pursue Mathematics further or to take up positions that call for innovative problem solving in concert with strong analytical abilities. Students may also opt for an inter-disciplinary BSc (Hons.) with Major in Mathematics and Computer Science. This allows them to get a wider variety of problem-solving skills as well as make them more attractive to the industry.  Undergraduate programmes can be followed by a one-year Ashoka Scholars Program (ASP) in mathematics. In addition, students of other disciplines can deepen their mathematics background by getting a Minor in Mathematics or a Concentration in Mathematics.     Each student will take a total of 15 mathematics courses. For completing a major in Mathematics, one must take the following courses (12 required courses and 3 elective courses). For detailed course content, please see the Course Outlines or the Department of Mathematics Handbook. Required Courses 1000 Level Courses Calculus Linear Algebra Multivariable Calculus 2000 Level Courses  Algebra 1 Probability and Statistics Real Analysis Algebra  2 Metric and Topological Spaces 3000 Level Courses Complex Analysis Mathematical Modeling (Differential Equations) Linear Algebra and Matrix Analysis Elementary Differential Geometry Elective Courses In addition to the 12 required courses, three electives are required. The elective courses offered vary from semester to semester depending on student interest and the availability of faculty. The elective courses offered by the department so far are as follows.  CTS Course Introduction to Proofs This cannot be counted as a math elective if counted as a CTS requirement. 3000 Level Courses Statistical inference I Fourier Analysis Introduction to Combinatorics Galois’ dream Introduction to Algebraic Combinatorics 4000 Level Courses Topological Spaces Measure Theory Functional Analysis Random Graphs Topics in Analysis Mathematical Foundations of Data Sciences Algebraic Number Theory Topics in Stochastic Processes   Each student will take a total of 9 Mathematics courses and 9 Computer Science Courses and will top it up with any course either from Mathematics / Computer Science avoiding double counting.

The contents of the actual courses and references followed may be different.     Department of Mathematics Handbook      Ashoka University’s department of Mathematics offers a variety of undergraduate programmes which prepare students to pursue Mathematics further or to take up positions that involve innovative problem solving through strong analytical abilities.     The most important thing I learned from my time at Ashoka is how to think creatively about mathematics. The CTS Intro to Proofs class, in particular, taught me that math is more than just a collection of theorems and proofs; good mathematics tells a story! Ashoka taught me how to effectively communicate mathematics. Narmada Varadarajan (Founding Batch), Ph.D. student, University of Toronto  I was given enough room and support to make mistakes and slowly build up from ground zero in all of my math courses. My professors’ investment in me made life at Ashoka more warm – whether it was spending ridiculous amounts of time during office hours on a concept I could not wrap my head around, giving me advice on life problems, welcoming my ideas for the department, showing up for my performances, or not letting me take the easy way out when I really wanted to. Math is a difficult subject, and I would not have been able to survive it without my brilliant and warm peers and juniors, and our endless coffee-fueled solving sessions. Saloni Mehta (UG’20) Business Analyst, Arthur D. Little India  The Ashoka math undergraduate program provides excellent preparation for students interested in pursuing a career in mathematical research. At Ashoka, I was exposed to a variety of courses from many different areas of mathematics. Each course was taught by an expert in the area that the course pertained to. As a consequence, I found that I was taught mathematics at the proper level of rigour, depth, and clarity. The option to complete a capstone thesis in mathematics allowed me to get exposed to various facets of modern mathematical research, which helped me decide to pursue a career in research. Siddharth Mulherkar (UG’20) – PhD Student, University of California, Los Angeles (UCLA)  The math department offers an incredible range of possibilities for the study of mathematics (including colloquiums, advanced electives and ISMs). It seriously cares about cultivating the research interests of its students, which is rare at the undergraduate level in India. Ojas Kumar (UG’22)  I am in a process of learning the essence of math from the point where I missed out on things. Ashoka is providing me the ambiance for rigorous learning. Enjoying the process well. Anulya P. (UG’22)  The Mathematics Department at Ashoka University, in my experience offers one of the most advanced undergraduate curriculums amongst the few other Indian institutions like the IITs, ISI, CMI etc. The courses offered range from basic to some of the advanced ones which are usually hard to find in other Indian undergraduate programs. The courses cover the appropriate standard material every undergraduate math major is expected to know. One of the distinguishing features of our program is that it offers a better flexibility in adjusting the courses to our convenience by allowing us to take certain courses later in the undergraduate years or even retaking some courses for a better understanding or even improving the grades. Moreover, the learning and research conducive concepts of Independent Study Modules (Reading Courses) and a Capstone Thesis under a particular faculty mentor, are one of the most unique features of the mathematics undergraduate program at Ashoka in the Indian context. The Mathematics undergraduate program at Ashoka also prepares us well for pursuing graduate studies in Mathematics or related fields abroad or in India. Manas Srivastava (UG’20) – ASP’22  The Math department at Ashoka is like a family. The small batch sizes and excellent student-faculty ratio means that the students and faculty get to know each other well. The professors are extremely approachable for mentorship, guidance, and also provide us with the opportunity to pursue guided research projects in fields of our interest. The mathematical training that studying Math at Ashoka enables us to become better problem solvers, researchers, and employees. Aayush Soni (UG’21), ASP’22 batch  Math was something I have always been unsure about– too many other things interested me. But I think that’s what’s great about math at Ashoka. You get to do things outside of math. If you’re ever stuck on a problem for too long, you can always go build a clay sculpture or hear your roommate rant about the fundamental flaws of democracy and think to yourself, “maybe solving this differential equation might just be an easier task than fixing years of social inequalities that have stemmed from capitalism.” And maybe, if you’re smart enough, you might just figure out a way to solve both.

It is a doorway to some of the most beautiful and profound phenomena in the universe, e.g. black holes, supernovae, Bose-Einstein condensates, superconductors. It is a driver of lifestyle-changing technology, e.g. engines, electricity, and transistors. And it is a powerful way of perceiving and analysing problems that can be applied in various domains, both within and outside standard physics. The beauty and profundity of the phenomena studied by physicists offer romance and excite passion; the utility of its discoveries and the power of its methods arouse interest. These methods can be very intricate and demanding: theoretical physics requires a skilful combination of physical and mathematical thinking, and experimental physics requires some of this along with the ability to turn tentative ideas into physical devices that can put those ideas to the test. The successful practice of physics demands mathematical and mechanical adroitness, persistence, and great imagination. Fortunately, the physicist’s imagination is nourished not just by physics but also by other areas of human enquiry and thought, of the kind that an Ashoka undergraduate is expected to encounter. With all of this in mind, the physics programme has been designed to: (i) allow students wishing to major in physics to discover real physics and make a wise choice, in the first two semesters; (ii) provide a thorough training in fundamental physics, in the following three semesters; and (iii) bring together everything learnt earlier, and give students the option to pursue more advanced courses in physics or branch out into other areas, in the final semester. The idea is to accompany those wishing to become professional physicists as they take the first steps in that direction, and to introduce everyone who goes through the programme to the physicist’s way of thinking.    Students wishing to major, minor, or pursue a concentration in Physics are expected to take the introductory course in calculus (Calculus I) offered by the Mathematics Department. Students wishing to major in Physics should plan to take it in their first semester. Mathematical level: All theory courses are calculus-based. The level of mathematical sophistication will increase progressively. The mathematical-physics courses will be application-oriented rather than proof-oriented. A student should have studied Mathematics at the +2 level in school. Those who do not have the requisite mathematics training should take the mathematics Foundation Course and the Calculus course as early as possible. Labs: All lab courses will involve extensive use of instruments to make observations. These experiments will in general illustrate ideas studied in the accompanying theory courses. The use of computers: Many theory courses will include computational exercises, generally using the programming language Python. Labs will also require the use of computers. Duration: Theory courses – Two lectures a week each lasting 1.5 hours. Laboratory courses – One 3-hour lab session per week (plus one optional 3-hour lab session for students to complete their work.)    Students wishing to major, minor, or pursue a concentration in Physics are encouraged to take the introductory course in calculus (Calculus I) offered by the Mathematics Department. Students wishing to major in Physics should plan to take it in their first semester. Number of courses required to major in physics: 15. 100 credits (FCs + CCs + Major courses + other courses). Of these, the 13 courses of the core curriculum are mandatory, and 2 electives may be chosen of those offered (only level 3000 or above). Students are of course free to take as many of the electives as they wish.   Students wishing to major, minor, or pursue a concentration in Physics are encouraged to take the introductory course in calculus (Calculus I) offered by the Mathematics Department.  Number of courses required to minor in physics: 6 (24 credits). Of these the two gateway courses – Mathematical Physics I: Mathematical and Computational Toolkit and Lab 1: An Introduction to Physics through Experiments – are compulsory. At least two more courses should be taken from among the core courses offered in semesters 3, 4, and 5, provided appropriate prerequisites have been satisfied for these courses (recommended courses: Classical Mechanics and Thermal Physics). The remaining two may be either other compulsory or elective courses offered by the Physics Department or cross-listed with Physics, provided appropriate prerequisites have been satisfied. In place of one elective course, a student may take an Independent Study Module (ISM) of equivalent credit.   The Department of Physics also offers a Minor in Astronomy, the requirement for which is six courses (24 credits). Two of these are core courses (compulsory):  The Physics of the Universe (theory) and Observing the Cosmos (lab). Four other courses are to be chosen from the following seven electives on offer: Cosmic Messengers – I (theory), Cosmic Messengers – II (lab), The Earth and Other Planets, The Violent Universe, Astrophysical and Geophysical Fluid Dynamics, Introduction to General Relativity with Application to Cosmology, and Computational Astrophysics and Geophysics.   Students wishing to major, minor, or pursue a concentration in Physics are encouraged to take the introductory course in calculus (Calculus I) offered by the Mathematics Department.  Number of courses required for a concentration in physics: 4 (16 credits). Of these the two gateway courses – Mathematical Physics I: Mathematical and Computational Toolkit and Lab 1: An Introduction to Physics through Experiments – are compulsory. At least two more courses should be taken from among the core courses offered in semesters 3, 4 and 5, provided appropriate prerequisites have been satisfied for these courses.   Semesters 1 and 2: Discovering College-level Physics: Students wishing to major in physics are expected to take, in the first semester, the introductory course in calculus offered by the Mathematics Department. The physics-major sequence begins in semester 2, with two courses, one in theoretical physics and the other in experimental physics. The first purpose of these courses is to provide an experience of undergraduate-level physics on the basis of which a student can decide whether or not to major in physics, i.e. they are gateway courses. The second purpose of these courses is to serve as an introduction to the physicist’s way of thinking about problems and solving them, something that has proved useful not just to physicists but also to those in other disciplines that make use of quantitative methods and experiments, e.g. mathematics, computer science, economics, psychology, and biology. Semesters 3, 4, and 5: The Physics Core: The physics courses in semesters 3, 4, and 5 form the core of the physicist’s undergraduate canon: Mathematical Physics II, Classical Mechanics, Electricity & Magnetism in Light of Relativity, Thermal & Statistical Physics, Oscillations, Waves & Optics, Quantum Mechanics I, and Statistical Mechanics, and three accompanying labs. Anyone majoring in physics is expected to be thorough in these areas. Semester 6: Choosing a Direction and Bringing Physics Together: In semester 6 there will be a required course, The Physics of Matter, that brings together much of the physics learnt in earlier semesters, so that the student leaves with a view of physics as an integrated subject. In addition there will be two more elective courses.   Probability and Statistics, offered by the Department of Mathematics.      Ashoka University’s Department of Physics offers a methodically crafted undergraduate programme to students. Students get expert guidance to launch a career in Research, Innovation & related fields.     Graduating with a Physics degree at Ashoka helps in improving one’s inquisitive qualities backed with the ability to come up with ideas and experiment on those. The Physics labs are my absolute favourite as they provide students with the freedom to work on the lab experiments with their own methods which helps in a better understanding of the subject and one can see many innovations take place. There definitely were moments where everything seems just too difficult to complete but once you are through, there’s no better a feeling. I feel anyone who has graduated with a Physics degree at Ashoka may not remember every formula, every equation for the rest of their lives but it gives them the confidence to take on anything that comes ahead no matter how difficult it may seem. Anand Waghmare ASP 2021        The gateway courses (Mathematical and Computational Toolkit and Laboratory 1) are the mandatory courses to pursue a physics minor. Apart from these two, the student is expected to take 4 courses of their choice. Of these 4 courses at least two should be taken from among the other core courses. The remaining two can be core or elective courses and one of them can also be an ISM. So, in total a student has to do 6 courses to complete a minor in Physics.   The gateway courses (Mathematical and Computational Toolkit and Laboratory 1) are the mandatory courses to pursue a physics concentration. Apart from these two, the student is expected to take 2 courses of their choice from among the core courses. So, in total a student has to do 4 courses to complete a concentration in Physics.   You can reach out to the Academic Representative of the Department.   The mandatory gateway courses are offered in the spring semesters. Other core courses are spread throughout the 6 semesters. All courses are not offered in every semester.    The student is expected to have a science/mathematics background in their high school (at +2 level). Calculus is a recommended course to be taken in their first semester.   Yes. They are independent of the theory courses in terms of the number of credits – 4 credits for each theory or lab course.

The Department of Political Science encourages students to explore the connections between the major and other disciplines, by cross-listing courses across departments and by encouraging students to ask questions that are not constrained by disciplinary boundaries.   The Department of Political Science’s curriculum is organized around the four conventional pillars of the discipline: Political Theory, Comparative Politics, Indian Politics and Research Methods. This is complemented by a variety of elective courses. Each course category has an entry-level course, which is required for the major. Beyond that, students can choose their courses according to their inclinations.    Each student will take a total of 12 courses towards the major. For completing a major in Political Science, one must take the following courses (4 required courses +8 electives). The minimum credit requirement to complete the major with the department is 100 credits (including FCs + CCs + Major courses + other courses): Western Political Thoughts (I) or Introduction to Political Theory Introduction to Comparative Politics Introduction to Indian Politics Quantitative Research Methods or Qualitative Research Methods Eight electives in Political Science (including a maximum of three cross-listed courses)   Each student will take a total of 6 courses towards the minor. For completing a minor, a student has to take the following courses (3 required courses +3 electives). The minimum credit requirement to complete minor with the department is 24 credits: Western Political Thoughts (I) or Introduction to Political Theory Introduction to Comparative Politics Introduction to Indian Politics Three electives in Political Science (including a maximum of 2 cross-listed courses)    Each student will take a total of 4 courses towards the concentration. For completing a concentration, a student has to take any two of the required courses and two other electives (2 required courses + 2 electives): Two required courses other than the methods’ courses Two electives in Political Science (including a maximum of 1 cross-listed course)    1. Major in Politics and Society (ID Course- Political Science and Sociology & Anthropology) (Kindly note that this major has been discontinued for batches after UG 2021) A student needs to take a total of sixteen courses, out of which one needs to take eight courses in Political Science. Out of those eight, four courses are mandatory, while rest four will be electives (4 required courses + 4 electives). The minimum credit requirement to complete an ID Major is 116 credits (including FCs + CCs + Major courses + other courses). The required courses from the Political Science side are: Western Political Thoughts (I) or Introduction to Political Theory Introduction to Comparative Politics Introduction to Indian Politics Quantitative Research Methods or Qualitative Research Methods (in either Sociology & Anthropology or Political Science) Four electives in Political Science (including a maximum of 2 cross-listed courses) 2. Major in Politics, Philosophy and Economics (ID Course- Political Science, Philosophy and Economics) Each student needs to take a total of sixteen courses, out of which one needs to take a minimum of four courses in Political Science. If a student takes a minimum of eight courses in Political Science, then it would qualify for a Degree in PPE with a specialization in Political Science. The minimum credit requirement to complete this ID Major is 116 credits (including FCs + CCs + Major courses + other courses). The mandatory courses from the Political Science side are (3 + 1/5): Western Political Thoughts (I) or Introduction to Political Theory Introduction to Comparative Politics Introduction to Indian Politics One elective in Political Science (4)/Five electives in Political Science (8) Note: In case of 4 courses in Political Science, a student can take a maximum of 1 cross-listed course. In case of 8 courses in Political Science, a student can take a maximum of 2 cross-listed courses.

Only the required courses are mandatory and can be taken in any sequence, irrespective of levels.   No. Required courses cannot be not substituted by summer courses.   No.   In case you have done Political Ideologies in Spring 2017 or Introduction to Political Theory in Spring 2018, you need not do WPT I. If you have done Dynamics of State Formation with Prof. Vinay Sitapati in the past, you fulfill the requirement for Introduction to Indian Politics. However, if you pursue these courses in any other semester, they will count only as electives and not as requirements, except for Introduction to Political Theory.   Yes.   No. We do recommend that you take WPT II after WPT I, but it’s not a pre-requisite.   Yes, you can, with validation from Prof. Sircar for quantitative courses and from the HoD for qualitative courses. In any case, you have to inform the HoD, the OAA and the Department Manager about this change.   Cross-listed courses are those courses which arise out of a discipline different from Political Science but are cross-listed with Political Science. Students can take upto two cross-listed course in any semester, provided all other rules are satisfied. The following is a summary of the rules around cross-listed courses: Pure Major in Political Science: Maximum 3 ID Major in Politics and Society: Maximum 2 ID Major in PPE with 8 courses in Political Science: Maximum 2 ID Major in PPE with 4 courses in Political Science: Maximum 1 Concentration in Political Science: Maximum 1 Minors in Political Science: Maximum 2    Write to the professor teaching that course to express your individual interest. Request the professor to directly email the course syllabus to the Head of Department, Political Science. The department will then take a collective decision, communicate with the professor directly, and then inform the students.   No. It is normal for courses to not be cross-listed with other departments in every semester that they’re offered. If you took a course, which was cross-listed in the semester that you took it, it will count towards your degree. Please cross-check the course code of such courses in your LMS.   No. Only ASPs can write a thesis with the department. But you can do an ISM (Independent studies Module) with faculty. Some faculty offer ISMs – individual or group-based – others take proposals from students.   Only ASP students are eligible to TA for courses. The department notifies all ASPs of TA requirement at the beginning of the semester and calls for applications. But in recent years there has been a scarcity of courses available for TA-ship. So students are advised not to depend upon it.   Yes, provided you fulfil other requirements meant for graduation.   Yes, but this is at the discretion of the professor offering the course. In case the new course is being offered by another professor (for example, because the original professor has left), the decision lies with the professor of the new course.

The B.Sc. (Hons.) programme in Psychology introduces students to core topics like Neuroscience, Social Influence, Psychotherapy and Psychopathology.   The Psychology Department offers a range of courses structured around three tiers: Fundamental Courses, Core Domain Courses, and Electives. These courses give students both the breadth of the discipline and sufficient depth for students who wish to have a more narrow specialization within a domain. Note that some courses have prerequisites (courses that must be taken before enrolling in a particular course); co requisites (courses that must be taken concurrently); and preclusions (courses that have sufficiently similar emphasis and must not be taken together with that course). Most courses are worth 4 credits (unless otherwise stated), and the workload for each 4-credit course is about 10 hours per week.     The two 1000-Level Courses are Gateway Courses and are typically prerequisites for taking higher level courses. It is strongly recommended that students take a Gateway course and SRM-I as soon as possible. Beyond this, the department does not impose a sequence in which to take core courses. Note though that some courses have prerequisites (courses that must be taken before enrolling in a particular course); co-requisites (courses that must be taken concurrently, that complement each other’s knowledge base if taken together); and preclusions (courses that have sufficiently similar emphasis and must not be taken together with that course). Often, elective courses will have a gateway course, one or more statistics courses and one core domain course as prerequisites. Note that the first digit of the course code specifies whether the course is at an introductory level to be taken in the second or third semester (1000), a core course level to be taken in the third or fourth semester (2000), a higher level elective (3000), a course specifically envisioned for fourth year ASP students (4000), or a specific graduate level course (6000). Some courses that are listed both at undergraduate and graduate level cover the same material but offer advanced assignments for graduate students. While the third and fourth digits just track and group multiple courses in various subdomains, the second digit of the course code specifies the overall course domain: 0 Introduction, Statistics or Methodology domain 1 Bio domain 2 Cognitive domain 3 Developmental domain 4 Clinical domain 5 Social domain 6 Electives offered by visiting faculty 7 Instructional electives 8 Methodology electives 9 Lab or research module   The structure of the psychology curriculum resembles a pyramid, with Fundamentals (Gateway, Statistics and Research Methodology) at the top-tier, Core Domains (Biological, Cognitive, Developmental, Clinical, and Social Psychology) in the middle-tier, and Electives at the lowertier. Students are encouraged to complete their Fundamentals and Core Domains as early as possible, because many of these are prerequisites for upper-level electives.   Each student must complete 12 courses towards the major (12 x 4 = 48 credits). To complete a major in Psychology, one must take the following 8 required courses (8 x 4 = 32 credits) and any 4 electives (4 x 4 = 16 credits): PSY101: Introduction to Psychology/Thinking Like a Psychologist (Gateway Courses) PSY201: Statistics and Research Methods- I (Statistical Course) PSY 202: Statistics and Research Methods- II (Statistical Course) PSY211: Introduction to Neuroscience (Core Domain Course) PSY221: Cognitive Psychology (Core Domain Course) PSY231: Developmental Psychology (Core Domain Course) PSY241: Social Psychology (Core Domain Course) PSY251: Clinical Psychology (Core Domain Course) Students can also apply up to four 4-credit courses taken at accredited universities elsewhere (i.e., summer abroad or exchange programmes) towards the major requirements, contingent on the formal approval of Ashoka University and the Psychology Department. Other than cross-listed core courses or cross-listed elective courses offered by the Psychology department, students are not encouraged to fill up on more than 3 electives offered by other departments and accepted for cross-listing by the Psychology department.   Each student must complete 6 courses towards the minor (6 x 4 = 24 credits). The student must take the following three courses (3 x 4 = 12 credits):  PSY1001/PSY1003: Introduction to Psychology/Thinking Like a Psychologist PSY2001: Statistics and Research Methods- I PSY 2002: Statistics and Research Methods- II   The student may take either 2 or 3 of any of the following courses (2 x 4 = 8 credits OR 3 x 4 = 12 credits):  PSY2011: Introduction to Neuroscience (group A) PSY2021: Cognitive Psychology (group A) PSY2031: Developmental Psychology (group B) PSY2041: Social Psychology (group B) PSY2051: Clinical Psychology (group B)   Students are encouraged to ensure they take at least one course from Group A, and at least one course from Group B.  The student may take 1 elective course, worth 4 credits.  Independent Study Modules do not count towards the minor. Students who have taken Quantitative Research Methods (Political Science) are no longer permitted to avail of an exception, although students graduating in 2021 with that understanding may do so after writing to the Head of the Department for permission. Students should note that it may be difficult to complete a minor within three years because (i) the psychology courses offered may clash with their major courses; (ii) some courses require prerequisites; and (iii) some courses are offered only once a year. Note also that the courses specified in the above descriptions are tentative; exact course listings will depend on available faculty and their actual offerings.   Each student must complete 4 courses towards the concentration (4 x 4 = 16 credits). The student PSY1001/PSY1003: Introduction to Psychology/Thinking Like a Psychologist PSY2001: Statistics and Research Methods- I PSY 2002: Statistics and Research Methods- II PSY2011: Introduction to Neuroscience (group A) PSY2021: Cognitive Psychology (group A) PSY2031: Developmental Psychology (group B) PSY2041: Social Psychology (group B) PSY2051: Clinical Psychology (group B)   Psychology majors intending to go for a summer abroad or semester-long exchange programmes should be aware that most upper-level psychology modules have prerequisites, which may not be explicitly mentioned in the host universities’ webpages. In general, students should clear as many Fundamental and Core Domain courses before going for a summer or semester abroad. For courses taken at host institutions abroad to count towards their Psychology degree at Ashoka, students must fill a credit transfer form stating the courses they plan to take at the host institution and send this along with the detailed course syllabi and course timings to the HoD, copying the professors who offer the equivalent course at Ashoka. Ashoka University matches the number of transfer credits with the number of contact hours, subjected to OAA’s regulations for the maximum number of credits allowed to be transferred throughout a student’s candidature. A typical course at Ashoka is 4 credits (13 weeks x 3 hrs = 39 contact hours). The final decision on whether credits amassed at a summer/semester institution can be transferred to your degree requirements at Ashoka will be of the HoD. Students should follow this protocol and read the frequently asked questions here first before seeking advice from the Program Coordinator during their planning stages.   Independent Study Modules (ISMs) are research modules. In general, students can do theoretical research (write review papers) or empirical research (e.g., conducting experiments), or both (e.g., propose a topic, run an experiment, and write results). Different professors have different ways of conducting an ISM. Enrolling for one requires the student to consult the relevant faculty and register one’s interest. ISMs are not necessarily pre-defined courses: while some faculty may offer a set of ISMs that align with their research, students may also propose novel ISMs to a faculty member. The decision to enroll a student in an ISM is ultimately that of the faculty member conducting the ISM.   Only two courses/8 credits worth of Independent Study Module(s) can be taken by each student during their three-year UG Psychology program. 4th years/ASPs can take two courses/8 credits worth of Advanced ISMs that ideally build upon past research experience to the satisfaction of the faculty with whom you take it. Because an ISM is a research module, it will help students gain research experience. Research experience is very important if you want to go on to masters/PhD degree. But even if you do not want to do this, and you are just simply curious at how knowledge is produced, or you want to try your hands at producing new knowledge instead of absorbing knowledge in a classroom, doing an ISM is a useful experience. In some sense, every theory that you know now stems from a research idea, which then turns into an exercise to find empirical evidence to prove/disprove the hypothesis.   To meet the research experience requirement, you must complete 1.5 credit hours of research experience using one of the following two options: Option A: Participate in Department of Psychology faculty-led research Option B: Summarize an empirical psychology article. All PSY101 students are required to complete this requirement. In the sections that follow, the requirements for research participation and review of an article are outlined. Please read over these sections carefully: Why do we have this requirement as part of PSY101? A key learning objective of PSY101 is for students to gain an understanding of psychology as a science. An exciting way to learn about psychological research is to engage in psychological research firsthand! By participating in research, you will be able to learn more about the different types of research conducted by the psychology faculty at Ashoka. In addition, you will be able to learn about psychological research from a participant’s perspective. We encourage you to try and participate in research to meet this requirement as far as possible, and to review an empirical paper if you are not able to or do not want to participate in research. What is the research requirement for PSY101? You need to complete a total of 1.5 research credits to meet the requirement for this course. One hour of research participation is worth 1 credit. If a particular research lasts half hour, you get 0.5 credits, which is the minimum (i.e., even a 15-min experiment is worth 0.5 credits). If you choose not to participate in research, you will need to complete a review of a research article for 1.5 credits Besides earning research credits, will I be rewarded in any other way for participating in a research study? Some studies do give rewards to participants (e.g., money), but some do not. This depends very much on the study itself. How do I participate in research? A list of available options of studies is shown on our course website. The list may be expanded (e.g., new studies come onboard) or shrink (e.g., an researcher has gathered enough data) as the semester progresses, so do check from time to time. You can review the study details and the requirements to participate and sign up for participation accordingly. Please note that the studies listed here have received the approval of the Ashoka University Institutional Research Board (IRB). Please do not sign up for to participate in a study and miss your appointment! In case you have signed up for a study and need to cancel, please contact the researcher at least 24 hours before your assigned time. What are the guidelines for reviewing articles?  If you choose this option, please do the following: Choose a research article (not a review article) in psychology. It is important to know the difference between a review article and a research article. One way to do this is by looking for a study referenced in your textbook. Alternatively, you can look through psychological journals to select your article. Make sure your article includes original research carried out by the authors. The article should include clear method and results sections. Write a two-page review (excluding the title page and reference list) of the article. The review should include a description of hypotheses, research method, results, and conclusion. Make sure to end with a short analysis (i.e. what you got out of the article). You may not understand the statistics reported in a results section, but you should still be able to understand what the research found. Your submission should include a title page with your full name, semester, year, course number. The paper must be typed and double-spaced. You must use Times New Roman font with a 12-point font size. All margins must be 1”. The paper should be sent as a Word document. Please make sure to meet these guidelines to get the credit for your submission. Attach a copy of the article you have summarized (doc or .docx format) at the end of your write-up. Please make sure your summary is written in your own words and not copied from the article. Plagiarism is a serious academic offence. Print and submit your summaries by Apr 29 at a mailbox marked “Research Participation Form/Research Summaries” outside Rm 608 (Admin Block). Each report will be graded as Satisfactory (S = 1.5 credit) or Unsatisfactory (US = 0 credit) at the end of the semester. When do I participate in research/meet the requirement? The deadline for completion of the requirement is Sunday, April 29 by 11:59pm. This is a firm deadline. We strongly encourage you to complete this requirement earlier in the semester. It is very likely that there might not be enough studies or research time slots for you towards the end of the semester. Furthermore, even though this requirement may not seem like a lot of work right now, it will add to your workload with finals and course assignments more so at the end of the semester. What do I do after I participate in each experiment? You will be given a Research Participation Form at the beginning of the semester. You should get the faculty researcher, research assistant, or research student to sign off this sheet whenever you participate in his or her study. At the end of the semester, or whenever you have completed your research participation requirements, drop the form off at a mailbox marked “Research Participation Form/Research Summaries” outside Rm 608 (Admin Block). What happens if I do not meet the research experience requirement?  The research experience is an important component of the educational experience for PSY101. If you do not meet this requirement by the deadline indicated, your grade will drop as follows: Completed the 1.5 credits research requirement — no drop in grade Completed 1 credits — half a level drop in final grade (i.e. A to A-; B+ to B) Completed .5 credits —1 level drop in final grade (i.e. A to B; B+ to C+) Completed 0 credits — 1.5 level drop in final grade (i.e. A to B-; B+ to C)    Undergraduate Psychology Handbook      Ashoka University’s department of Psychology offers undergraduate courses which are thoughtfully designed. Students get comprehensive support to pursue a career in the ever-expanding field of Psychology.      Doing Psychology in the 11th and 12th Grade (CBSE, ISC, IB, A Levels (Cambridge)) is a prerequisite to taking Thinking Like a Psychologist. If the student has not done Psychology in the 11th and 12th Grade, they must take Introduction to Psychology. If they have done Psychology in the 11th and 12th Grade, they can take either course, although there will be overlap between Introduction to Psychology and the material they have already covered in the 11th and 12th.   Yes, completing the courses mentioned below are usually sufficient to waive off SRM-I, but not SRM-II. Further, these courses are not counted in the credits amassed towards Psychology. Note that the following courses can not be counted towards a waiver for SRM1 starting from Spring 2021: Quantitative Research Methods offered by the Political Science Department, while the following can: Probability and Statistics (Mathematics Department), Statistics for Economics (Economics Department).    As long as you have satisfied the foundational and other requirements specified for your batch by the OAA, you just have to complete the major requirements specified above to get a Psychology major – these have not changed from batch to batch.    The prerequisites are there to ensure you won’t have difficulty following the material. Students can get waivers by writing to the instructor of the course, but often students who get waivers later find the course prohibitively difficulty.   This is entirely the call of the faculty who offer these electives; as department head I have already put in the request. If interest in a course vastly exceeds the cap, we can always consider hiring someone to teach an extra section. For this, the N category in the student tracker needs to exceed our planned sections, so this is where you should indicate interest or need to take a course long before the semester in which you plan to take it.    The OAA does not permitting rescheduling of courses after pre-registration begins. Requests for rescheduling may constitute a preference of a minority of students, and so there is no responsible way to respond to these requests. Before every semester we circulate a form to assess interest in these courses at .   The process for this is for the faculty offering X course to send the course syllabus to the Head of the Psychology department as well as any faculty who teaches an area of psychology adjacent to or similar to the material covered by course X. If the Psychology department finds the course to be methodologically in line with the scientific approach of the department and relevant to the study of behaviour, we could decide to cross-list it and give it a Psychology course code.   If one wants to be able to access all the core courses in one’s third semester without further barriers, one needs to take both these courses. However, one can always do them in the third semester, and most core courses in the fourth, and have the whole third year for finishing cores and taking electives – this makes scheduling harder, but it is not impossible – so do not panic if you don’t do these courses in the second semester – there is enough wiggle room for being one semester behind, but not more.    Applications for doing TAships and the Capstone Thesis are only open to ASPs. The procedure for applying for the former has been specified above and registration for the Capstone Thesis happens on the LMS after consultation with a faculty member who will act as thesis advisor. However, you can always prepare to do research with a faculty member with or without academic credit, starting as early as your first year.   Ashoka does provide letters explaining our transcript. Graduate schools know they get grades from a variety of course and teaching and grading styles from different liberal arts universities. This is why other things that directly convey student quality like research publications, essays, SOPs etc. matter so much in graduate school applications – they directly convey your skills to the reader, and letters of recommendation also convey a sense of your work ethic.   Your first step should be to check if your question has already been answered at :. If not, place the question on the FAQ at . You will get a reply within 24 hours, often right away.

The aim of this course is to learn: 1) recursive competitive equilibrium models that feature individual and firm heterogeneity ; and 2) how to solve numerically for the equilibrium of these economies. These models are helpful to analyze a wide range of questions pertaining to business cycles, income distribution, asset pricing etc. The course will start with a discussion of aggregation with heterogeneous agents. It will then move towards economies with incomplete markets, where agents can only borrow and save through a risk-free bond. The last set of lectures introduce economies with heterogeneous firms, equilibrium default in incomplete markets models through the particular example of sovereign default, and conclude with a brief introduction to heterogeneous agent New Keynesian models.

The course consists of three broad themes: Monetary Policy, Macro-Finance, and Heterogeneous Agents. The Monetary Policy theme will discuss various topics related to monetary policy including non-neutrality of prices, discretionary policy and issues of time inconsistency, and the design of optimal monetary policy. The Macro-Finance theme will discuss macroeconomic asset pricing and the role of financial frictions in modern macroeconomic models with topics in the Lucas model, macroeconomic asset pricing puzzles and responses of the literature, and macroeconomic models of banks. The Heterogeneous Agents theme will break the assumption of a representative agent and study macroeconomic models with heterogeneous agents in a New Keynesian setting and their insights for macroeconomic inequality. By the end of this course students will have the tools to engage with literature at the frontier of modern macroeconomics.

The introduction to neuroscience course should have already given you all a sense of how single neurons perform basic computations of addition and subtraction and how elementary circuits might perform more complicated computations. We will explore how these multi neuron circuits work in this course not through textbook material or conventional teaching, but rather through reading primary scientific material, with which you should already be familiar. In this class, we will put together a series of topics in neuroscience for further study. A rough set of topics is provided in the syllabus, but we can explore really any other system that people are interested in. In every week, one class will involve teaching, and the other will involve discussion and presentations. In the second class, students take turns contributing to the collective understanding of the field by presenting individually selected readings, based on your own interest.  Then we will collectively discuss advances in each field, relying on looking up fresh primary research papers together.

Technical aspects of RG will be discussed  by considering specific cases,  like, polymers, quantum systems, and  critical phenomena. The approach taken will help us  to see how  RG can lead to a proper description of a system, avoiding any prior knowledge of its phenomenology.  We shall start with the real space RG, and then go over to various avatars of the  field theoretic RG. If time permits, special topics to be discussed include, the Kosterlitz--Thouless transition (xy model), critical dynamics, nonequilibrium systems. Prerequisites:  Basic statistical mechanics (at the level of Reif or Pathria).   Elementary notions of diffusion, random walks (though not essential) No prior knowledge of phase transitions or critical phenomena needed. RG results will be used to explore the nature of the critical point.  Ref:   1.  Chaikin-Lubensky covers most of the topics,  2.  D. Amit's book is complementary to Ref. 1. 3.  McComb: Renormalization Methods 4.  Cardy: Scaling and Renormalization in Statistical Physics 5.  Kardar: Statistical mechanics of fields 6.  relevant reviews and papers.

These theories will deal with both single person decision problems as well as strategic interactions. We will also study evidence of nonstandard behavior in both the field and the lab, and relevant policy discussions. Pre-reqs: ECO 2400 (Econometrics).

It also assumes that they have unbounded cognitive abilities to figure out the best course of action in any situation, including the ability to make all kinds of complicated logical inferences. When it comes to facing uncertainty, it assumes that individuals prescribe to the demands of Bayesian rationality. Further, when strategic interactions are involved, the demands on rationality that game theoretic analysis makes is even more stringent. In recent years, behavioral economics has challenged this orthodoxy by producing considerable evidence and novel theories that shows that traditional decision and game theoretic models may be an inadequate positive description of human behavior and interactions. This course will introduce theories and paradigms that showcase this impressive body of research. These theories will deal with both single person decision problems as well as strategic interactions (behavioral game theory). We will also focus on decision making under uncertainty and critically engage from a behavioral perspective with the foundational Bayesian paradigm. At the same time, we will show that our theoretical investigations have serious ramifications for questions in many areas of economics. We will also highlight why such behavioral concerns may require us to address many public policy issues through new and innovative approaches as well as re-think the basis on which we do welfare economics. In short, the course is a methodological intervention into economic reasoning and critically interrogates the neoclassical paradigm.

My recent book on the Jugalbandi: BJP Before Modi is required reading for the course, though there will be plenty of material that challenges my arguments. The course is divided into four parts: 1924-1980 (origins and the Jana Sangh); 1980-2014 (The BJP Before Modi); 2014-present day (the Modi era). While the book is interested in causal arguments, the mode of analysis will be largely historical.

This course provides the historical context within which we can locate and understand the current crises of international political economy. Global capitalism is inherently volatile and unstable. Indeed, policies and institutions to harness and tame it are an integral part of its history. Globalization involves not just the movement of goods, capital and people, but also of ideas that shape our preferences. In consequence, the periodic crises that are endemic to global capitalism lead to sudden changes in our conception of values (both in a monetary and non-monetary sense). This revaluation of values, in turn, leads to the search for new epistemic frameworks, institutions and policies for managing the global economy. International politics bulks large in this process. This course focuses on key moments in the history of global capitalism through the long twentieth century. Starting with the depression of the 1870s, we will chart the rise of globalization up to the First World War, its reconfiguration during and immediately after the war, the great depression and challenges to liberal democracy, the reordering of the global economy after the Second World War, the collapse of this order in the 1970s, the remarkable resurgence of globalization through to the financial crises of the past decade. The course situates this arc of the global economy within the broader international history of the 20th century as well as the history of ideas and policymaking paradigms such as the gold standard, neoliberalism, Keynesianism, monetary coordination, development, capital account liberalization, macroprudential regulation and so forth. By so doing, the course allows us to understand global capitalism as more than an economic phenomenon—as embedded in geopolitics and social conflicts, ideas and ideologies.

This work set the pattern for historiography in the classical Chinese language, a narrative form which contrasts in many ways with the norms of modern history writing. At the same time, Sima Qian dealt with many of the same questions that perplex modern historians: how do we explain causation among seemingly unrelated events? How do the circumstances of the historian’s life shape their writing? How do we understand gaps in our sources? In this class, we will reflect both on traditional Chinese historical practice and on our own. In the first part of the class, we will discuss the world into which Sima Qian was born and the kinds of historical writing that were current before his transformative work. In the second part, we will read excerpts from the Records of the Grand Historian. In the third part, we will investigate his influence on Chinese historical writing in both its official and unofficial forms. Finally, we will experiment with writing in Sima Qian’s narrative style ourselves.

We will begin by formulating the primary concepts: the laws of motion and the dynamical equations as differential equations which need to be integrated to find the solutions of mechanical problems. We will stress the importance of conservation laws not only in the solution of otherwise intractable dynamical problems but also their wider scope beyond Newtonian dynamics. As applications we will deal with central force motion and the harmonic oscillator. Besides their historical importance, these are rich and instructive examples illustrating the basic concepts. The second part of the course deals with Analytical Mechanics: We will make the transition from newtonian to lagrangian dynamics by introducing the notion of generalised co-ordinates. The variational principle is then introduced as a unified way of dealing with diverse physical problems. Lagrange’s equations are re-derived and the transition to the hamiltonian form of dynamics is made thereby introducing the concept of phase space - a notion of special importance in statistical mechanics. Subsequently, the Poisson bracket formulation would be discussed. Throughout we will stress the importance of, and the connections between, symmetry principles and conservation laws. This course would be a stepping stone for later courses in quantum and statistical mechanics. It should also enable you to later study more advanced topics in classical physics like fluid mechanics, non-linear dynamical systems and chaos.

In looking at the new realms of ideas opened up by the post-colonial turn, it explores both their conceptual underpinnings and their limits. Structure:  Each week there will be one lecture on a theme and one discussion of the suggested readings. The lecture will give an overview of the theme, locating the conceptual shifts in thinking about the theme and reflecting on the historiographical significance of these ideas.  In the second lecture the discussion will develop around student presentations on the  readings suggested for the week. Each week, students will be expected to choose any one reading from the three or four suggested for each theme, read the text critically, and write a short note of about 500 words. In the class, we will discuss the write ups collectively and read specific parts of the texts closely.  At the end of the semester students would have to choose any one theme and write an essay of about 3000-4000 words. This will require a deeper and wider engagement with the texts relevant to the theme. When necessary, supplementary readings will be  suggested for the end term essay. Drafts of the essays will be discussed in separate  discussion groups of 4-5 students at the end of the semester.  Assessment will be based on: (i) weekly submissions and class discussions (35 percent), and (2) the end semester term paper (65 percent).

On the one hand, the experience of the industrial megacity is both a topic of and inspiration for some of the formal innovations associated with the historical avant garde. But to equate the ""urban"" with the ""modern"" is itself a kind of provincialism. Ostensibly ""rural"" places do not fall outside of history because of the concentration of economic and political power in cities, but moreover, many countrysides often bear the marks of their integration into global relations of production, relations visible in the landscape if one knows where and how to look. Not only are phenomena such as pollution and urban sprawl ways in which industrial production is inscribed on the landscape, but the ideological divide between urban and rural itself shapes the way in which these spaces are perceived. With that in mind, in this course we will encounter texts that think through the city/country divide. We will read fictional texts from a variety of traditions by authors such as Thomas Hardy, Ishimure Michiko, Arun Kolatkar, and W.G. Sebald and theoretical texts by authors such as Karl Marx, Raymond Williams, Theodor Adorno, and Mike Davis.

For the first topic, we will begin by looking at the question of the foundations of subjective probabilities and Bayesianism. We will study the classic approaches of De Finetti, Savage and Anscombe-Aumann to this question. Thereafter, we will focus attention on the large and impressive literature on decision making under ambiguity that has emerged in the last three decades or so. Ambiguity, here, refers to decision settings in which a decision maker perceives “ . . . uncertainty about probability, created by missing information that is relevant and could be known” (Frisch and Baron, 1988). That such decision settings exist was pointed out by Ellsberg (1961). His work showed how ambiguity represents a normative criticism of the subjective expected utility framework of Savage (1954) and, by extension, of the Bayesian paradigm. It was David Schmeidler’s work in the late 1980s that revived interest in this area of research. We will cover important models like Schmeidler’s Choquet expected utility, Gilboa and Schmeidler’s maxmin expected utility, Klibanoff, Marinacci and Mukerji’s smooth model of ambiguity, and Siniscalchi’s vector expected utility For the second topic, we will, first, look at the case against rational choice theory. Thereafter, we will focus on a selected set of topics which will be proposed as responses to the descriptive (and at times normative) limitations of rational choice theory. Amongst them will be Kahneman and Tversky’s heuristics and biases program, along with a discussion of dual process theories of cognition. We will also look at prospect theory and the theme of reference dependent preferences, more generally. Other topics that will be covered are theories of temptation and self-control, sequential choice procedures featuring multiple rationales, choice theories featuring limited consideration and theories of social influence.

Setting up the exercise in decision theoretic terms has the advantage that it disciplines us to make our claims in terms of (in-principle) observable behavior. The course will begin by laying out what the substantive content of rationality in neoclassical economics entails along with an appreciation of the “genealogy” of this concept. Our discussion in this regard will also focus on the Bayesian paradigm and the foundations of subjective probabilities, which are key organizing principles when we talk about rationality in environments featuring uncertainty. Thereafter, we will look at the criticisms of rational choice theory. We will then focus on a set of topics and themes which will be proposed as responses to some of the limitations of rational choice theory. Amongst them prominent themes and questions include: Rational choice theory is too narrowly focussed on the outcome of choices and doesn’t pay enough attention to the decision making procedure by which those choices are arrived at. By ignoring these procedural aspects of decision making, the theory ignores important details like cognitive limitations that decision makers are faced with when making choices. We will, therefore, want to think about theories that take these procedural aspects of decision making more seriously.In keeping with our search for descriptively richer accounts of behavior, we will delve into the heuristics and biases program of Kahneman and Tversky. In this context we will also discuss dual process theories of cognition.We will discuss Kahneman and Tversky’s Prospect theory and the paradigm of reference dependent preferences, more generally. We will ask, just like they did all those years ago, as to what the “true carriers of value are”?Neo-classical economics takes individual preferences as exogenous and given. But, in lots of context, aren’t preferences endogenous? Aren’t things like sexist preferences or casteist preferences socially constituted and not exogenous? If so, how should we go about theorizing endogenous preferences? What about social influence and how it shapes our preferences and choices?What about decision making in social and political context? Do the same principles with which we think about decision making in a more “private” context carry over seamlessly to them? Are the basic decision theoretic insights with which we analyze people’s consumption decisions adequate when we analyze, say, their voting decisions?

Ambedkar (1891-1956) while the two were at Columbia University. The former is one of America’s most prominent 20th century philosophers, associated with a school of thought called “pragmatism,” while the latter is one of India’s most compelling 20th century political minds, associated with anti-caste struggle and constitutional law. Given how the Republic of India and the United States of America are two of the world’s most important democracies, the preceding facts might raise a question about the relationship between democracy and pragmatism. In this course we will explore the question about whether democracy could be considered the politics of pragmatism, taking the relationship between Ambedkar and Dewey as something of a case study. That is, if “The pragmatic method…interprets each notion by tracing its respective practical consequence” and asks “What difference would it practically make to any one if this notion rather than that notion were true?” (William James, Pragmatism [1907]), and if democracy is “government of the people, by the people, for the people” (Abraham Lincoln, “Gettysburg Address” [1863]), then is there something about an insistence on the “simple test of tracing a concrete consequence” (James) that either contributes to or is the product of some sort of democratic disposition? Or, in fact, does pragmatism—as “the explicit reduction of reason to its instrumental value”—in fact undermine the meaningfulness of freedom commonly associated with democracy by eliminating “the question of external reality” and precluding any “transcendent criteria for human action” (Stanley Aronowitz in Marx Horkheimer, Critical Theory: Selected Essays [1972])? To answer such questions, our readings will extend beyond Ambedkar and American pragmatists like James and Dewey to consider material by Richard Rorty, Ludwig Wittgenstein, the Frankfurt School, Karl Marx, Martin Heidegger, and others.

We will go over select topics in applied research in micro development economics including the role of institutions, intra-household decision making, poverty traps, labour markets, consumption and savings, human capital investment in health and education, the changes in poverty, demography, impact of early-life shocks on human capital formation and policies. The course aims to equip students with an understanding of a range of empirical methods in development. The course gives you an overview about how economic models can provide insights into understanding behaviour and subsequently illustrate how to assess the empirical implications of the models with appropriate choice of research design and econometric methods. By the end of the course students should have a basic understanding of the major papers in the related literature and be in position to apply the economic framework and econometric tools to conduct a research problem of their choice in development economics.

It commences with the ideas of Adam Smith, moves on to those of the other members of the Classical School such as Malthus and Ricardo, and ends this section with the writings of Marx. It next journeys to the works of the economists of the early twentieth century including Marshall, Hayek and Keynes whose work continues to matter in policymaking today. Finally, we study the rise after 1945 of Development Economics, focused on the economic problems of Africa, Asia and Latin America, which it was considered required a treatment on its own. In this section the course engages in particular with the ideas of Amartya Sen who opened up a new view of development, and applied it to an understanding of India’s progress since 1947. As the course progresses it will reveal the various modes of reasoning that have been deployed in economics and also serve as a brief economic history of the world in the past two centuries.

Hons programme in Economics and Finance will help students to understand the principles of economics and its applications to financial systems and organisations. The department recommends that students complete mathematics in Classes 11 and 12 to be eligible for any economics-related major or minor. For students who have not studied mathematics in Classes 11 and 12 to be eligible for any economics-related major or minor, they need to: a) Take MAT 1000: Calculus (a 1000-level course) offered by the Mathematics department in their first semester and b) Secure at least an A- to be eligible In addition to quantitative techniques in mathematics and statistics, the curriculum will also include advanced financial techniques such as derivatives pricing, risk management and portfolio management.   Introduction to Finance  This is a compulsory course for Second-year students Majoring in Economics and Finance. The aim of this course is to introduce students to a broad range of financial markets operating in a modern economy and to provide you with a basic understanding of these markets. At the end of the module, students should develop a basic awareness of the day-to-day workings of such markets and an informed understanding of key events, such as the recent financial crisis. The topics covered include the role and types of various financial markets; the role and function of financial institutions and their regulation; and the conduct of monetary policy. Various financial markets such as the bond markets, government as well as corporate bonds; the money markets; the stock markets; and the markets for financial futures and options will be covered. The role of central banks and other regulatory institutions in ensuing the smooth functioning of these markets will be explored. Financial Markets and Asset Pricing This is an elective course in Finance offered to the third years. This course focuses on international financial markets and exchange rates. Topics include pricing in the foreign currency and Eurocurrency markets, use of forward exchange for hedging, short-term returns and market efficiency in the international money markets, foreign currency options, international capital asset pricing, pricing of foreign currency bonds, currency swaps, Eurocurrency syndicated loans, foreign currency financing and exposure management. Managing Financial Institutions This is an elective course in Finance offered to the third years. What are financial institutions and why are they special? This course will introduce you to a range of different financial institutions (FIs) – banks, insurance companies and asset management companies – and the services they provide. Common to all FIs is the need to manage financial risk. In this course, we will analyse the different types of financial risk faced by FIs, understand the methods used to measure them, as well as the instruments and processes used to mitigate them. Finally, this course will cover the need for and the extent of regulation of FIs. In particular, we will focus on the financial crisis of 2008 and the changes to the global financial regulatory regime that have taken place as a result of it. Advanced Financial Management This is an elective course in Finance offered to the third years. This is an applied finance course that tackles some of the common problems faced by corporate managers in business settings. Topics covered include project evaluation, capital structure theory, equity valuation, dividend policy, mergers and acquisitions, and equity issuance (IPOs and SEOs). International Finance This is an elective course in Finance offered to the third years. This course will survey a variety of topics in international finance and open-economy macroeconomics. The stress will be on an understanding of the intuition behind the theories, not on mathematical proofs or on replicating empirical results from the literature. The course will not shy away from complex ideas but will try to make the ideas as accessible as possible. The course will address the following main topics: balance of payments, exchange rate determination in open economy models, parity relationships between spot and future exchange rates, risks in global finance (foreign exchange risk and country risk), the management of foreign exchange risk with forwards and options, term structure of interest rates, basic characteristics of trade finance and investment instruments and international capital flows.   The foundation course requirements for this major are as given in the pure Economics major page.

This course delves on different aspects of waste management. The course is divided into four parts. The first situates the course in the broad realm of Environmental Economics. It introduces the concepts of property rights and public goods. The second part looks at solid waste creation, collection and disposal. Third part talks about recycling, and design for the environment. The final part introduces the concept of Circular Economy. Since the course derives its relevance from current waste management practices, class participation, presentations and discussions are of utmost importance.

In so doing, we will practice keyelements of writing in academic and non-academic contexts: developingand supporting a point, dialoguing with others, structuring a piece ofwritten work, etc. We will further consider how the fairy tale and itsconventions of magic, the supernatural, and the fantastic areappropriated into realist and so-called high literature, giving rise to anew aesthetic category: the uncanny.

This course will enable students to understand the role of financial markets and institutions in shaping the economic and business environment of the nation. With the help of some simplifying frameworks and models, the students will be equipped to develop a series of applications of principles from finance and economics that explore the connection between the firm, financial markets, financial institutions and the broader economy. The financial markets studied will include money markets, bond markets, insurance markets, stock markets and currency markets. Students will study the role of financial institutions (intermediation and innovation) played by central banks, commercial banks, investment banks, insurance companies and mutual funds in facilitating the flow of funds in the economy. Keynesian IS-LM theory and the loanable funds theory provide the theoretical background for the course and help students develop simple analytical frameworks to study the interaction of individuals, firms, governments, markets and the aggregate economy. The students will also understand the role of regulation in the overall functioning of financial markets and institutions in the economy.

Is it an act of faith or is it a secular enterprise? Is it a discrete and distinct archive or is it entwined with the ritualistic and functional dimensions of human life?

For example, Rafael Landívar based his epic poem about the people and land of Mexico, the Rusticatio Mexicana (1782) on the form of Vergil's Aeneid, but drew inspiration for the content from pastoral poetry as well as local, indigenous knowledge. The revenge plays popular in Elizabethan England, like Thomas Kyd's The Spanish Tragedy and Shakespeare's Hamlet, adapted the Roman tragedies of Seneca, with their gruesome tales of murder and vengeance, rich with ghosts and other supernatural elements. Science fiction may seem like a modern genre, but in the second century CE, the Syrian author Lucian wrote a story about a journey to the moon, and into the depths of the sea, into the belly of a whale, the True Histories. Is this the world's first science fiction novel? What does this tale have in common with Jules Verne's Twenty Thousand Leagues Under the Sea (1871)? What narrative elements do the Jataka Tales, Aesop's Fables, and One Thousand and One Nights have in common? How did modernist poets like Ezra Pound, Gertrude Stein, and Rabindranath Tagore respond to literary traditions, as they sought to re-invent poetic forms? In this course, we will seek to understand the forms of literature by examining their creative metamorphoses over time, from antiquity to the present.

It introduces English students to literary history as articulated through different genres: the epic, the tale, the novel, lyric, drama, and the short story. Rather than regarding literary forms as fixed categories with specific rules, we will instead examine them as dynamically shaped by, and in conversation with, their social and historical contexts. We will consider how these forms have meant different things at different times, both to understand the transformations of literature and the changing meanings of genre itself.We will look at the epic and how its world view has transformed from Gilgamesh to John Milton’s Paradise Lost; tales and how their preoccupations have changed from Geoffrey Chaucer’s Canterbury Tales to T.S. Eliot’s The Waste Land; novels and how their social function and meaning vary from Joseph Conrad’s Heart of Darkness to Amruta Patil’s Kari; lyric poetry and how its modes of intimacy have transformed from William Shakespeare’s Sonnets to Audre Lorde’s poetry; drama and how its representation of gender has morphed from Aristophanes’ Lysistrata to Caryl Churchill’s Top Girls; and short stories and how their uncanny imaginative scope has been reconfigured from E.

But more importantly, their inquiry focused on the question—where emancipation lay? While they were hugely influenced by Hegel, Marx, Weber, Freud, among others, their analysis moved beyond traditional approaches in political and social theory. Focusing on the transformative and revolutionary potential of theory, the writings of Max Horkheimer, Walter Benjamin, Theodor Adorno, Herbert Marcuse, Jurgen Habermas—as critical theory—has influenced disciplines as varied as political science, sociology, gender studies, film and cultural studies, comparative literature among others. Apart from reading the texts of these first generation Frankfurt School intellectuals, in the course we will simultaneously study the responses to the development of their thought, particularly their migration to America, and their impact on the New Left.

In this course we will read and write about fairy tales from a variety of historical and cultural contexts. In so doing, we will practice key elements of writing in academic and non-academic contexts: developing and supporting a point, dialoguing with others, structuring a piece of written work, etc. We will further consider how the fairy tale and its conventions of magic, the supernatural, and the fantastic are appropriated into realist and so-called high literature, giving rise to a new aesthetic category: the uncanny.

The choice of topics may vary with instructor and year. For Spring 2022, the course will focus on applications of game theory towards understanding problems of economic development. Game theory is the study of strategic decision making by individual agents. One of the most important insights of game theory is that self interested behaviour by economic agents can lead to suboptimal social outcomes. Problems of economic development may themselves be viewed as situations where the society is trapped in inferior outcomes despite individuals striving for better outcomes. Economic development is, therefore, a very fruitful field for application of game theory. This is what this course will focus on. Some of the topics we will study are development traps, environmental problems, land tenure arrangements in agriculture, problems of savings and credit in developing societies, social learning, institutions and property rights, conflict and violence and problems of establishing trust in society. In every topic, the focus will be on how game theoretic modeling can help us understand these problems better and allow us to look for solutions.

Complex questions about sexuality, conflict, self, identity and science are navigated with reference to books, and fragments of books, from across geographies and chronologies These books and questions form the core of the course and its explorations.    Department: English | Semester: Monsoon 2022 In this course, we will address the question “What is sexuality” by reading some of the many books that have shaped our current ideas of the subject. These books will range across chronologies, cultures, and disciplines, starting with classical and medieval Indic texts — the Kamasutra, Sufi poetry — to ancient Greek and Roman classics — the Symposium, the Metamorphoses. We will also read philosophical texts like the Discourse on Method, biological texts like The Origin of Species, psychoanalytical texts like The Interpretation of Dreams, and literary texts like Mary Shelley’s Frankenstein. Together, these “great books” will allow us to trace threads that have gone into our current ways of thinking about sexuality.    Department: History | Semester: Monsoon 2022 and Spring 2023 In this course, through certain texts, and in some cases, parts of texts students are invited to explore a series of complex and variegated themes and issues.  Some of these are the relationship between knowledge and ignorance, darkness and truth; the relationship between identity and destiny; narratological techniques; understanding of the historical processes and ideology; and the quest to discover the self to emancipate it from the restrictions that society imposes on the self. The books through which these issues are pursued are: Isa Upanishad King Oedipus By Sophocles Mahabharata (Selected Themes) Vindication of The Rights Of Women By Mary Wollstonecraft Tuhfat Al Muwahhidin By Rammohun Roy The Communist Manifesto by Karl Marx A Room of One’s Own by Virginia Woolf      Department: History | Semester: Monsoon 2022 It is a truism that words mean something, and that they count for a great deal in life. However, the relation between thought, reality, and time has always been a matter of debate. The Greek word theoria meant contemplation, the act of looking, which later acquired the sense of an intelligible explanation based on observation and reasoning. Historia meant inquiry, the search for knowledge; and it evolved over time to mean investigations and accounts of past events. Philosophia meant the love of wisdom. These words, which relate to human experience in its deepest sense, prompt my choice of great books. As to why this is so should become clear in due course. The books are: Simon Leys; The Hall of Uselessness: Collected Essays, (2011) Tibor Szamuely; The Russian Tradition; (1974) Margaret Chatterjee; Gandhi and the Challenge of Religious Diversity; (2005) Albert Camus; The Rebel: An Essay on Man in Revolt; (1956) Mark Lilla; The Reckless Mind: Intellectuals in Politics; (2001) Stanley Rosen; Nihilism: A Philosophical Essay (1969) The first three books deal (in part) with history; with what is called tradition; and the treatment of these themes in political writing and fiction. The latter three deal with philosophical issues directly. I will introduce students to these books and specify certain chapters for required reading. Their scholarship will educate us and prompt us toward further study. Some will illuminate important historical events; others will raise issues common to human experience regardless of time and place.    Department: Undergraduate Writing Program | Semester: Monsoon 2022 In Quest Of Who goes on quests? And what kinds of quests are they? Epics across mythologies have followed courageous (and controversial) men and women on long, unforgettable journeys. Novels host protagonists seeking all kinds of things: the ship captain vowing revenge against a whale; the little prince leaving his asteroid home in search of wisdom. A play reveals a quest that is absurd, even circular — what if you are waiting for someone who never arrives? — and one poet describes the spiritual quest of pilgrimage as an “urgent, unreasonable sojourn into uncertainty.” People have wondered and wandered into adventure long before they began writing about it, and this course will attempt to catch up with some of them and follow along. We will go in quest of them, just as they did before us. And we will also question them, just as they did before us.    Department: Sanskrit | Semester: Spring 2023 Rock, paper, palm leaf – Making sense of texts and textual traditions In this course, we will examine texts from the subcontinent, with an eye to mapping their natural history. That is, we will read selections from stories, poems, inscriptions, and other, more conventional ‘texts’ in Sanskrit, Prakrit, and Tamil, and try to understand the larger literary and intellectual projects that they are part of. We will learn to attend to the authors’ discursive and figural techniques, while also gathering a sense of the transmission and reception of their works and ideas. What is the connection between story and ritual? What does an inscription say? Who reads it? Who wrote the grammars of ritual, poetry, politics, and ethics? Were they read? And were these protocols followed? These are some of the questions we will pose in this course. Texts we will read from include:  Veda (verse, prose), early sutra texts Mahābhārata, Yājñavalkya-smṛti Ṭherīgāthā, Aśvaghoṣa Kāmasūtra, Piṅgala (Prosody) Arthaśāstra (Politics), Aśokan, Nāneghāṭ Inscriptions Mahābhāṣya, Tolkāppiyam (Grammar) Carakasaṃhitā (Medicine), Nāṭyaśāstra (Theatre) Eṭṭutokai, Gāhā sattasa’ī (Anthologies of poetry) Yogasūtra, Varāhamihira Meghadūta, Setubandha (Kāvya), Mehrauli and Mandasaur inscriptions Tamil bhakti poems Vāsudevahiṇḍi and the Dhuttākkhāṇa    Semester : Spring 2023 This course will look at books that negotiate the relationship between bodies and words. Books are both textual and performative in nature, and we will pay attention to both these aspects over the course of the semester. Beginning with classical texts from the subcontinent (Samkhyakarika and Yoga Sutras) that are reliant on body or matter, the course will examine the 16th century Protestant drive to vest ultimate authority in the text, establishing the word’s primacy over both body and lived experience. Great Books will critically examine this idealism through readings of Spinoza, Weber, Bauman, Vivekananda and Tagore; focus on modern Indic writings that articulate the tension between tradition and modernity, theory and experience particularly in relation to body and caste (Ambedkar/Gandhi, Sundar Sarrukai/Gopal Guru, Ramachandran Guha); and conclude with readings of poetic texts from across the world, Kalidas, Ikkyu, Hafiz, Annamachrya, Akka Mahadevi, Whitman, Neruda and others that go beyond the word, transgress the norm, and reinstate the body, its sensuality and eroticism, at the centre of the self.                    Programme Interested InUndergraduate ProgrammeYoung India FellowshipYSPPhDMA - EconomicsMA EnglishMSC Biology Year of Admission2022-232023-242024-252025-26  Subscribe to our communications [current_url]     Plot No. 2, Rajiv Gandhi Education City, National Capital Region P.O.

The underlying belief is that the contemporary world and how nations relate to each other within cannot be understood without the historical context. The course thus brings together some of the skills and methods of the historian with themes that are relevant for comprehending the contemporary world. The courses for this Major are a mix of Indian and World History, International Economics, Sociology of European Societies and Global & Comparative Politics.    To earn a Bachelor’s degree, each student will be required to complete a total of 28 courses over the programme period of 3 years of 2 semesters each. The programme will require 16 courses in the major papers/subjects. Foundational papers/subjects will constitute the remaining coursework for the student, adding up to 12 courses.    Social and Cultural Patterns of Ancient India This is an introductory survey course on Ancient Indian history. Working within a broad chronological framework spanning several thousand years, in the lectures, the student will be acquainted with the social formations of the early subcontinental history. Beginning with the Harappan civilization, which was one of the four oldest civilizations of the world, the lectures will trace the development of Indian history through the Vedic Age, formation of city-states and monarchies, emergence and decline of the various ancient Empires, the intercivilizational exchange between the Indian subcontinent and the surrounding areas through trade, travel, conquest or cultural exchange. The weekly discussions of this course will be woven around themes such as ancient literary traditions; the significance of inscriptions, archaeology and numismatics; the world of early historical city; orient-gazing in travellers’ accounts; depiction of femininity in religious art; life in royal courts; the myths of creation in South Asian religions; and the rise and impact of Buddhism on the subcontinent, to name a few. Note: The teaching format for this course is two lectures and one class discussion each week; for the discussion the class is divided into smaller groups. The course instructor is responsible for the lectures and the TA for discussion sections. The readings consist of a combination of a textbook and of primary sources (of about 100 pages a week).  The course will have a midterm and a final examination, and written work of about 10-15 pages over the course of the term, in any combination of specific assignments. The Indian Middle Ages This is an introductory survey course on Medieval Indian history. The medieval Indian history is primarily seen as history of Delhi Sultanate and the Mughal Empire. However, this course discards the state-centric lens and examines cultural life, society, economy and arts of the Indian subcontinent from 7th century AD to the 18th century AD. The student will study about the way people dressed, the kinds of food they ate, the popular musical forms and the social norms that governed society and market. The course will help them understand how Islam integrated into the fabric of the subcontinental society, the role Sufi saints played in society and politics of empire and the impact of Bhakti saints on poetry, arts and the Indian caste system. The aim of the course is to dispel certain myths and stereotypes about the middle ages, especially in the Indian context. It will enable the student to question the picture of South Asia as a land ensconced in mysticism and religion; a society with a timeless and changeless civilization; a region fraught by communal and caste rigidities; and a society that was nudged out of its slumber with the advent of the ‘West’. Note: The teaching format for this course is two lectures and one class discussion each week; for the discussion the class is divided into smaller groups. The course instructor is responsible for the lectures and the TA for discussion sections. The readings consist of a combination of a textbook and of primary sources (of about 100 pages a week).  The course will have a midterm and a final examination, and written work of about 10-15 pages over the course of the term, in any combination of specific assignments. The Making of Modern India This is an introductory survey course on colonial South Asian history (1700-1947) intended for students with no prior knowledge of the subject. It begins with the demise of the Mughal Empire and the colonization of the Subcontinent by the European trading companies and the establishment of British supremacy. It goes on to examine the British colonial policies and ideologies, Indian reactions to colonial rule, coming into being of colonial cities, role of historical figures such as Gandhi and Jinnah, the region’s liberation from colonial rule and finally the partition of the Subcontinent into India and Pakistan. The weekly discussions of this course will be woven around themes and questions such as was there potential for capitalist development in India, was conquest of India by design or default, were colonial cities a microcosm of the empire, was British rule through military coercion or cultural hegemony, did colonial rule change the lives of Indian women for better, and was Indian nationalism a spurious historical force. Government records, travelers’ accounts, national textbooks, contemporary literary works, maps, paintings, music, speeches of political leaders, and Bollywood cinema will be used as course materials to help students envision the colonial history of the region. Note: The teaching format for this course is two lectures and one class discussion each week; for the discussion the class is divided into smaller groups. The course instructor is responsible for the lectures and the TA for discussion sections. The readings consist of a combination of a textbook and of primary sources (of about 100 pages a week).  The course will have a midterm and a final examination, and written work of about 10-15 pages over the course of the term, in any combination of specific assignments. From Aesthetics to War: History of the Modern West This is an introductory survey course in European history from Renaissance to the Second World War. The aim of the course is to familiarize the students with political, social and cultural developments in Europe from the 14th century AD to the 1950s. The course will begin with history of birth, rise and growth of Italian Renaissance and will take the students through the history of the Reformation, the long seventeenth century, the Glorious Revolution. Rise of print culture in Europe, the age of Enlightenment, the French revolution, Restoration of Absolutism, the Italian Resorgimento, German unification and the two history World Wars. The course material will be a mix of historiographical material and primary sources such as paintings, drawings, music, posters, lithographs, speeches, contemporary writings, travellers’ accounts, philosophical texts, and newspaper reports. Note: The teaching format for this course is two lectures and one class discussion each week; for the discussion the class is divided into smaller groups.

The readings consist of a combination of a textbook and of primary sources (of about 100 pages a week).  The course will have a midterm and a final examination, and written work of about 10-15 pages over the course of the term, in any combination of specific assignments. Reading Texts: The History of French Revolution This is a compulsory Reading Seminar focused on historiographical readings on a particular historical event, in this case the history of the French Revolution. The students are expected to read selected texts, critically analyze, discuss and review them. In this course the students will be assigned scholarly texts on the French Revolution which examine its history from different perspectives – George Rude’s The Great Fear, George Lefebvre’s The Coming of French Revolution, Albert Soboul’s The Sans-Culottes, Alfred Cobban’ Social Interpretation of French Revolution, Francois Furet’s Interpreting the French Revolution and Simon Schama’s A Chronicle of the French Revolution. This reading-intensive class will function as a semester-long conversation, between the students, the books they read and their fellow students. Contributing to discussion, pushing and responding to one’s peers’ ideas, and helping the peers to polish their writing constitute major elements of the students’ responsibilities in this class. Note: The reading of one book (along with supplementary readings such as reviews of the book or critical historiographical pieces related to the theme of the book) is divided over a two weeks with weekly discussions and blogging. The students should write at least 4000 words for this course – divided into 4 book reviews of 1000 words or 2 essays of 2000 words or 1 term paper of 4000 words. Each instructor will design their own Reading course. Ideally more than one Reading Course will be offered in a semester to give students an option of choosing one. Reading Sources – Colonialism and Culture in British India This is a compulsory Reading Seminar designed around a historical theme, event, process or personality but the reading comprises solely of primary sources, in this case Colonialism and Culture in British India. The aim is to train the students to interpret and analyze primary sources. The students are exposed the students to as many different kinds of sources as possible (visual, musical, written, epigraphic, numismatic, artefacts, statistical and oral). The weekly discussions focus on conceptual and methodological issues related to the use of particular kinds of sources. This reading-intensive class will function as a semester-long conversation, between the students, the books they read and their fellow students. Contributing to discussion, pushing and responding to one’s peers’ ideas, and helping the peers to polish their writing constitute major elements of the students’ responsibilities in this class. Note: This is a seminar format course: Discussions are to be followed by weekly blogs of 500 words. The instructor can design his or her assignments with at least 10-15 pages of writing. Each instructor will design their own Reading course. Ideally more than one Reading Course will be offered in a semester to give students an option of choosing one. Enlightenment & Empire (18th Century) This course focuses on the writings of thinkers and philosophers of Scottish Enlightenment – Rousseau, Kant, Adam Smith, Bentham , Hegel and John Stuart Mill. Their writings were fundamental to the making of the modern political world. This course will primarily focus on the discussion and debate on the relationship between liberty and commerce and the way enlightenment thought got harnessed in service of colonialism. This is not simply a course on political thought because the student will be reading major texts within their political and intellectual. It will enable the student to understand how a particular thought or philosophy is a product of its historical context. The interconnected of the texts studied will give the students a sense of a deep foundation in understanding the rise and growth of modern politics. Note: The primary form of instruction can either be lecturing or an in-depth discussion seminar. The expectation is that more time is devoted to discussion of primary and secondary readings. In these courses the coverage and analysis of historical material, and the discussion of historical methods and practices, are more in depth than in the previous courses.  Readings should be about 150-200 pages per week. Written assignments may be more sophisticated and extensive (often in the 20-25 pages or 4,000 words range, as a total of all writing assignments), and some of these classes may not require examinations. History of Silk Road: Premodern Patterns of Globalization (200BC-1453AD) The Silk Road is one of the earliest examples of premodern global connectivity. Extending from China to Roma, the Silk road created a cultural matrix of interconnectivity. It helped the travellers, trades, religious men, craftsmen and raiders who traversed the Silk Road, imagine a world bigger than their immediate spatial reality. This course will bring to fore the trade, religious, artistic and political connections between Han and Mongol China, Russia, Turkish tribes, Persian elite, Arabs and Roman oligarchies through the writings of primary documents, travelogues, film, art and music. The students will also be engaging in cartographic drawing in this course to map out the Silk Road. Note: The primary form of instruction can either be lecturing or an in-depth discussion seminar. The expectation is that more time is devoted to discussion of primary and secondary readings. In these courses the coverage and analysis of historical material, and the discussion of historical methods and practices, are more in depth than in the previous courses.  Readings should be about 150-200 pages per week. Written assignments may be more sophisticated and extensive (often in the 20-25 pages or 4,000 words range, as a total of all writing assignments), and some of these classes may not require examinations. A Global History of Cricket This is a course on the political history of British Empire as seen through the lens of cricket. The course examines how racial, class and caste histories were intertwined with the game of cricket. The course begins with conceptual readings on leisure history of British Empire and introduces the students to key texts on history of cricket written by CLR James which examines the racial roots of the game and the work of Ramchandra Guha which explores its caste dimensions. The course also takes a comparative approach where cricket is compared to other colonial sports such as polo and hunting. The course material will also draw on visuals from the Punch and the Illustrated London News and the commentaries and writings of contemporary authors. Note: The primary form of instruction can either be lecturing or an in-depth discussion seminar. The expectation is that more time is devoted to discussion of primary and secondary readings. In these courses the coverage and analysis of historical material, and the discussion of historical methods and practices, are more in depth than in the previous courses.  Readings should be about 150-200 pages per week. Written assignments may be more sophisticated and extensive (often in the 20-25 pages or 4,000 words range, as a total of all writing assignments), and some of these classes may not require examinations. International Economics In this course, students will learn about the theories that explain the nature of international trade, factors that decide the trade policy of nations and the consequences of such policies. The course will also cover certain topics in international macroeconomics like the concept of exchange rates, purchasing power parity, and the determination of exchange rates. Sociology of Post-Industrial Societies How do we observe, analyze, apprehend society when it is spatially dispersed and virtual, residing in networks and new forms of affinity? To what extent does technology shape society, or is it rather than technology is driven by social needs which shape and reshape it? Demonstrating how and why contemporary social theory has converged on common questions, across the disciplines (including philosophy, sociology, anthropology, economics, geography, ecology, history), the course will explore topics such as:- the city and urbanity, globalization, science and technology, environmentalism and the case for analysis of the world as a ‘system’ in which different parts are positioned in relation to a dominant ‘core’. Introduction to Political Thought The course will introduce fundamental concepts of political philosophy through a critical reading of some of the major texts and thinkers from both the western and Indian political traditions. The central question of the course will be to trace how various political thinkers have impacted the development of different political institutions, from the polis to government and democracy. Global Politics The focus of this course will be to understand how globalisation affects public and social actions and how state and non-state actors, individual and collective actors, cooperate and oppose each other on the world’s stage, reshaping classic inter-state relations. This course will be completely pluridisciplinary and will be based on case studies of some of the major challenges brought by globalisation – financialisation and economic globalisation, new interdependences, migration and conflicts, among others. It will also focus on the attempts at reorganising the world order after the fall of the Berlin Wall and will use cartography as tool for enlightening complex processes of global change. Comparative Politics A comparative study of political systems, this course will provide students with a foundational framework to examine political events through theoretical analysis, for instance, explaining the relationship between democracy and economic development, or the functioning of authoritarian regimes. This course will aim at developing tools for political comparison; to critically engage with concepts and events like democratic transition, democratisation, de-democratisation, political conflict, civil wars etc. Dynamics of State formation This course will examine the trajectory of State-building in India through an examination of the pre-Independence roots of the modern Indian state and its re-invention by the Constituent Assembly. It will also focus on the progressive reshaping of the Indian state – linguistic federalism, affirmative action, decentralisation, among other themes –, contextualised in their social and economic context. The terms and actors of the debates and controversies that have accompanied these changes will also be examined.

Can a historian combine literary prose while retaining a commitment to her sources? Does this combination diminish the rigor of the craft? The dominant mode of historical writing still shies away from seeing history as a literary genre. This stems fundamentally from a disavowal of language as anything other than a vehicle of communication; a belief than use of anything other than dry prose diminishes the scientific rigor of the discipline; and a refusal to think of historian as ‘writer’ – a label reserved for novelists. This course however makes a case for History as creative non-fiction, a literary art form. Critics may still raise the question why should history be written so? The answer to this question lies in the politics of our times. History is now being communicated in wide variety of ways which includes narrative nonfiction, magazine articles, op-eds, museum exhibitions, policy documents, blogs, podcasts, fiction and nonfiction film, twitter feeds, and memes. The accessibility of these modes of narration gives them popular currency but also opens them up to political exploitation. The historians in order to contend with fake and distorted versions of the past therefore need to widen their ‘writing repertoire’ to include other modes of narration. This course introduces the students to works of narrative historians (such as Jill Lepore, Saidiya Hartman, James Goodman, Louis Masur and Stephen Berry) combined with literary practice which will be woven around conceptual issues (emplotment, vantage point, time, space, testimony, memory, moral evaluations and lost histories) that go into crafting historical narratives. Each segment will be taught with the help of novels (Chronicle of a Death Foretold, Bronze Sword of Tehsildal Thengphakri, A Sense of an Ending, Karukku, When I Hid My Caste, Gravel Heart) and cinema (Truman Show, Rashomon, Eternal Sunshine of a Spotless Mind, Judgment at Nuremberg, Amistad and The Motorcycle Diaries). The semester-long assignment will be re-writing of a historical text in a narrative form interspersed with weekly writing exercises on writing tweets, Wikipedia entries, podcasts, infographics, policy briefs, and op-eds etc.                      Programme Interested InUndergraduate ProgrammeYoung India FellowshipYSPPhDMA - EconomicsMA EnglishMSC Biology Year of Admission2022-232023-242024-252025-26  Subscribe to our communications [current_url]     Plot No. 2, Rajiv Gandhi Education City, National Capital Region P.O.

It highlights continuities and changes in politics, economy and society by focusing on political structures, class, caste, gender, agrarian relations, urban life and trade. Apart from Hinduism, Buddhism, Jainism and the advent of Islam, the themes in religious history will include the age-old popular worship of snakes and yakshas and the pervasive influence of bhakti and tantra across religious boundaries. The emergence of regional configurations in politics and the remarkable efflorescence in literary expression, and art and architecture in the early medieval period will be highlighted. The course will also look at the many different ways in which the Indian subcontinent was connected with the wider world during these centuries.

The rich and varied ideas and thoughts from the ancient times to the modern age and their expression through art and artefacts, through literature and philosophical writings, will form the basis for discussions for an understanding of the plurality of Indian civilizations.    Semester : Spring 2023 This is a small course about a large and fascinating subject, that of Indian Civilizations. It has been structured in a way that it can be immersed in, I hope, with enjoyment. The course will draw out civilizational elements from prehistory till the present – through travels and lives, through ideas and art forms – in which small phenomena will be linked to the larger world of the Indian subcontinent and beyond. In the process, the course will explore a varied and rich tapestry that includes rock art, the Harappan Civilization, the iconic emperor Ashoka, the poetry of Bhakti saints, the travels of Indians beyond India and Mughal art along with its influence on European painters like Rembrandt. Indian civilization, as the course will emphasize, is not to be seen merely as part of the dead past but as an element that continued to be invoked in present times, by literary giants like Rabindranath Tagore and statesmen like Jawaharlal Nehru, and by more ordinary people in India’s villages and towns. The course will involve scholarly readings and literature, as also film appreciation and analysis.       Semester : Monsoon 2022 This course aims to provide students with an outline of the various influences that fashioned the civilizations that are integral to the history of India. The emphasis is on the plurality of Indian culture and tradition. The course is divided into two separate but interrelated parts. In the first part Rudrangshu Mukherjee presents the very broad themes of the civilizations from ancient times to the modern age. The themes are: Harrapan Culture Vedic Civilization Coming of The Buddha Ashoka Gupta Empire — Political Structure, Culture, Religious Ideas Coming of Islam — Bhakti And Mughal Pluralism British Rule — Indian Responses — Rammohun, Gandhi, Tagore In the second part Gopalkrishna Gandhi looks at some specific features of these civilizations. These features are Digging for the Future ‘Dancer’, ‘Priest-King’ and Bull – Life’s Rhythms in the Indus Valley (Discussing the possible reasons for their decline and the trajectories of their continuance ). Great Words The Past, Present and Future of Sanskrit ( A Post-Modern reflection on the Buddha, Mahavira and Sankara) Great Works The Tirukkural (Its ethical and romantic as opposed to didactic voltage). Kalidasa (His romantic and aesthetic as opposed to moral preoccupations) ‘Rock of Ages Cleft For Me’ Asoka’s Stones (The Imperatives of an Ethical Sovereignty) The Peacock Throne Shah Jehan’s Progeny and Abanindranath Tagore’s paintings (with a tangential sighting of Sarmad and the Sufis) Company – Colony – Country Dalhousie – as a Maker and Breaker of India Wavell – as a Soldier-Statesman who lost without knowing what he had lost    Semester : Spring 2023 The guiding idea behind this course is that civilization is not a homogenous, static cultural monolith, but rather a choir – not always harmonious – of many voices, narratives, and practices. The course overviews some of the unique cultural and intellectual developments, which have taken place in the Indian subcontinent, beginning with the mysterious Indus Valley civilization, and ending with political imagination in Bollywood films. We will explore the religious thought and practice of Hindu, Buddhist, and Jain religions, Indian philosophical traditions – both classical and modern -, classical aesthetic theory and literature, and interrelations between Islam and indigenous religions. We will attempt to look at Indian civilizations from several points of view – traditional and historical, sympathetic and critical. We will try to trace historical continuities and ruptures, examples of cultural synthesis and antagonism, as well as critically examine how cultural insiders and outsiders have imagined and represented Indian civilizations.    Semester : Monsoon 2022 In this course we explore the idea of Indian civilization, with civilization defined as varying expressions of collective vitality, and the emergence of creative rather than destructive forms of contestation and cohabitation within structures of hierarchy. Rather than a sharp break between tradition and modernity, we seek to understand the ways in which old and new theological and civilizational questions and forms endure and are transfigured across three domains: politics, aesthetics and ethics. In each of these domains we examine the birth of ideas, moving across religious and secular formations, such as, in politics, Gandhi’s idea of how brute force may (or may not) be transformed into soul force, as well as Ambedkar’s embrace of Buddhism; in aesthetics, we examine Hindu-Urdu cinema as a lyric tradition, situated alongside older lyric traditions, which have had a critical task of teaching a society defined primarily by caste (in marriage and social structures of interaction), how to express love and forms of friendship and intimacy with others; in ethics we examine the ways in which potentially hostile neighboring groups have found ways of living together, amidst older and newer contestations of ideas of high and low, or self and other. Through these and other examples of the birth of ideas within politics, aesthetics and ethics, moving across disciplines, theologies, texts, films, and images, this course aims to teach students to think creatively about key concepts in Indian collective and intimate life such as caste, tribe, religion, sexuality, and gender, and about civilization as forms of collective vitality that may also wane, or be replenished.    Semester : Monsoon 2022 | Spring 2023 This course unlocks the mystery called Indian civilizations. What were they after all? The Indian civilizations can be likened to the boggarts that pounced out of the cupboard during Professor Remus Lupin’s class on the Defence Against the Dark Arts (from the Harry Potter Series). The boggarts were shape-shifting non-beings and no one really knew what they looked like. On pouncing out, they at once took the form of students’ imagination and morphed into a tarantula, a dementor or an angry granny. Indian Civilizations are much the same. They don’t have any one form. They shift their shape according to the social group imagining them. For instance, for the nationalists, Indian civilization was the dazzling high Brahmanical and Sanskritist culture. For the hedonists, Indian civilization was about materialism and eroticism. For the Dalits, Indian civilization was about Aryan oppression of the indegenous peoples. For the European travelers, Indian civilization was seeped in social hierarchies and the personal despotism of the rulers. Through the semester you will come across several Indian civilizational boggarts. These encounters will expose you to the diverse imaginations that constitute the country that we know as India. Learning to appreciate this diversity will be your first lesson in Defence against the Dark Arts.   Faculty : Tanika Sarkar Semester : Monsoon 2022 This is a small but challenging course which covers a vast and complex ground and raises difficult questions. For instance, does the term “ civilization “ have a fixed meaning ? What aspects of historical experience are left out of such definitions, and why? Which categories of people are commonly regarded as the authentic creators of our civilization and who are left out of their ranks? Is there an Indian civilization which has a single, invariant essence, despite the immense cultural diversities in the subcontinent’s long history? If there is, indeed, a thread of unity that runs through all our historical epochs, then how do we define it? Is Indian civilization completely home-grown, developed from indigenous cultural resources alone? Or has it been enriched by many other cultures of the world which mingled with it? Is our civilization a seamless? harmonious phenomenon or is it also the product of conflicts and contradictions ? The course will try to address some of these questions. It intends to introduce the students to a few areas of Indian lives and cultures from prehistory to the modern age. It will focus on changing patterns of material and cultural production, knowledge forms, religious belief and ritual, among different communities in different historical periods. It will also explore the persistent inequalities in our collective social life and the marginalization of subaltern people who do not have access to the riches of our civilisation.

Our task is to understand the rationale for this phenomenon. The course is structured as follows. We start with the major theoretical approaches, realism, liberalism, and constructivism, and their understanding of the causes of war. We will then turn to the rationalist perspective to war and apply it to various issue-areas that have preoccupied both the scholarship and policy-making world. Issue-areas that will be covered include the nuclear proliferation, democratic peace, ethnic conflict, and terrorism.

This course provides an opportunity to critically assess the stories that shaped our understanding of morals, culture, and values, as well as those we will impart to future generations. In this discussion-oriented interactive course, we will read and review children’s books, examine the purposes of visual literacy, and write reviews on specific authors and illustrators. This course aims to examine how the books children read – from Aesop’s Fables to Amar Chitra Katha comics and the Harry Potter series – shape their outlook and emotional development. We will study the historical, creative, nurturing, emotional, and educational aspects of these forms of literature and their impact on us later in life. We will also consider why a study of children’s literature is important, and how it impacts pedagogies for children across borders. We will also examine the views of multiple theoretical thinkers and texts in conjunction with actual children's literature. We will ask the important but often overlooked questions about this particular genre, mainly focusing on Indian and Western children’s literature. The purpose is not so much to compare these two cultural offerings, but to give us a taste of both. We shall consider popular stories for children up to 12 years old, including Harry Potter and The Philosopher’s Stone, Amar Chitra Katha, Matilda, The Little Prince, Feluda and Mulan. At the same time, we will also study theoretical thinkers such as Jack Zipes, Seth Lerer, Paulo Freire, and Bruno Bettelheim to help us navigate the complex field of children’s literature in relation to issues of culture, religion, difference, gender, and sexuality. We will unpack the didactic intent as well as the pleasure principle that might have prompted the writers. Authorial intent is, however, only one part of our study; the other part is to see how children and parents receive these stories. Children’s literature creates moral as well as national frameworks that help acculturate young people. In examining the genre of children’s literature, we will consider various sub-genres such as picture books, fairy tales, fables, and chapter books.

Studies show that the majority of innovative products and services in an economy evolve from entrepreneurial ventures. By providing knowledge and skills important to the creation and leadership of such startups, the Entrepreneurship Concentration within the Computer Science Program at Ashoka University will aim to train the founders and leaders of tomorrow’s high-tech ventures. The program is designed specifically for students who want to be tech-entrepreneurs. Courses are approached from the perspective of the student whose primary interest is in technological innovation, whose primary concentration is on science courses, and who has little or no prior business education.  The curriculum structure for the Bachelor’s Degree programme in Computer Science and Entrepreneurship follows that of the University’s standard undergraduate programme curriculum structure. To earn a Bachelor’s degree, each student will be required to complete a total of 28 courses over the programme period of 3 years of 2 semesters each. The programme will require 16 courses in the major papers/subjects. Foundational papers/subjects will constitute the remaining coursework for the student, adding up to 12 courses.     Introduction to Computer Programming is the first course in our series introducing students to computer science. In this class you will learn the fundamentals of computer programming in Java, with emphasis on applications in science and engineering. You will also learn about the broader field of computer science and algorithmic thinking, the fundamental approach that computer scientists take to solving problems. This course tightly integrates the theory and applications of discrete probability, discrete stochastic processes, and discrete statistical inference in the study of computer science. The course will introduce the Minimum Description Length Paradigm to unite basic ideas about randomness, inference and computation. Students will be expected to use the Maple programming environment in homework exercises which will include numerical and symbolic computations, simulations, and graphical displays. This course focuses on advanced topics in modern computer architecture, illustrated by recent case studies. Topics include fundamentals of quantitative analysis; pipelined, out-of-order, and speculative execution; superscalar, VLIW and vector processors; embedded processors; memory hierarchy design; thread-level parallelism; multiprocessors and multi-core architectures, synchronization and cache coherence protocols. This course introduces some of the formal tools of computer science, using a variety of applications as a vehicle. You’ll learn how to encode data so that when you scratch the back of a DVD, it still plays just fine; how to distribute “shares” of your floor’s PIN so that any five of you can withdraw money from the floor bank account (but no four of you can); how to play chess; and more. Topics that we’ll explore along the way include: logic and proofs, number theory, elementary complexity theory and recurrence relations, basic probability, counting techniques, and graphs. Design and implementation of operating systems. Topics include process synchronization and interprocess communication, processor scheduling, memory management, virtual memory, interrupt handling, device management, I/O, and file systems. Hands-on study of Linux operating system design and kernel internals, including work with Android devices. Experience with commercial virtualization tools and open source software. This course is an introduction to models of computation, computability, and complexity. We will ask questions like: How do we define the abstract notion of “computation” or a “computer”? What problems can be computed? What problems can be computed efficiently? Can we prove that some problems can never be computed, no matter how fast our computers become? The course is highly mathematical and abstract; in particular, there will be minimal programming assignments (if any) and homework problems will frequently involve proving or disproving various assertions. Students are expected to be comfortable with the material covered in Discrete Math or the equivalent. Topics (not exhaustive): automata and the languages they define, context-free grammars and the languages they define, Turing machines, basic complexity theory (such as P vs. NP). Complete data structures and algorithms course. The course teaches the following topics : Objects and ADTs, Constructors and destructors, Data Structure , Methods, Pre- and post-conditions C conventions, Error Handling, Arrays, Lists, Stacks, Stack Frames, Recursion, Sequential Searches, Binary Search , Trees, Complexity, Queues, Priority Queues , Heaps, Bubble , Heap Sort, Quick Sort , Bin Sort, Radix Sort, Searching Revisited, Red-Black trees, AVL trees, General n-ary trees, Hash Tables, Dynamic Algorithms, Fibonacci Numbers , Binomial Coefficients, Optimal Binary Search Trees, Matrix Chain Multiplication, Longest Common Subsequence, Optimal Triangulation , Graphs , Minimum Spanning Tree , Dijkstra’s Algorithm , Huffman Encoding , FFT , Hard or Intractable Problems, Eulerian or Hamiltonian Paths , Travelling Salesman’s Problem. How do you optimally encode a text ?le? How do you ?nd shortest paths in a map? How do you desgin a communication network? How do you route data in a network? What are the limits of ef?cient computation? This course gives a comprehensive introduction to design and analysis of algorithms, and answers along the way to these and many other interesting computational questions. You will learn about problem-solving; advanced data structures such as universal hashing and red-black trees; advanced design and analysis techniques such as dynamic programming and amortized analysis; graph algorithms such as minimum spanning trees and network ?os; NP-completeness theory; and approximation algorithms. What makes a programming language like “Python” or like “Java?” This course will look past superficial properties (like indentation) and into the soul of programming languages. We will explore a variety of topics in programming language construction and design: syntax and semantics, mechanisms for parameter passing, typing, scoping, and control structures. Students will expand their programming experience to include other programming paradigms, including functional languages like Scheme and ML. How does Google always understand what it is you’re looking for? How does Amazon.com figure out what items you might be interested in buying? How can categories of similar politicians be identified, based on their voting patterns? These questions can be answered via data mining, a field of study at the crossroads of artificial intelligence, database systems, and statistics. Data mining concerns itself with the goal of getting a computer to learn or discover patterns, especially those found within large datasets. We’ll focus on techniques such as classification, clustering, association rules, web mining, collaborative filtering, and others. This course focuses on investigating, understanding, and implementing the process of founding a start-up firm. Elements of searching out new venture opportunities, matching skills with a new venture, financing, competitive strategy, intellectual property, and operating a new venture will be explored. The focus of the course will be the development and presentation of a business plan created by teams of students with various academic backgrounds. This course is designed to help students develop their knowledge, confidence, skills, and self-image necessary to pursue entrepreneurial ventures in such domains as business, government, and public service. It provides a foundation in the fundamentals of entrepreneurial leadership, as well as a source of inspiration and energy in the art and science of taking visions and bringing them to reality. Entrepreneurship is innovation in practice: transforming ideas into opportunities, and, through a deliberate process, opportunities into commercial realities. These entrepreneurial activities can take place in two contexts: the creation of new organizations; and within existing organizations. This course will present an entrepreneurial framework for these entrepreneurial processes, supported by case studies that illustrate essential elements. Successful entrepreneurs and expert practitioners will be introduced who will highlight practical approaches to entrepreneurial success. This course focuses on institutional and product marketing methods used by start-up to medium-sized companies. After an overview of basic marketing principles, the course will cover the spectrum from day-to-day marketing activities of the entrepreneurial business to positioning and strategy. Students will learn to analyze, formulate, and implement marketing strategy, and learn the fundamentals of market research, pricing, and reaching and selling to customers. This course focuses on understanding how to construct the data and find appropriate financing for a start-up venture. Various forms of financing are introduced: vendor financing, factoring, etc. Through a medley of tests, case studies, and team exercises, students exercise basic financial skills such as financial statement formulation, NPV analysis and scenario analysis. This course focuses on the key components of starting a venture-scalable high-tech business. The course will examine the full life cycle of a startup; from opportunity assessment and market sizing to R&D and operation plans and go-to-market and distribution strategy. The course will also cover venture capital, legal considerations and team building. The role of angel investors, venture capitalists, and non-dilutive funding will be covered in depth. Student teams will write and present a business plan to active venture capitalists.

The three broad sets of decisions that finance managers undertake are—decisions on where to invest the resources or funds that the business has raised, either internally or externally (the investment decision), decisions on where and how to raise funds to finance these investments (the financing decision), and decisions on how much and in what form to return funds back to the owners (the dividend decision). The course will include the central concepts of modern finance: basic accounting principles and financial statements analysis, net present value, valuation models, efficient markets, and the trade-off between risk and return, fundamentals of capital structure and an introduction to corporate dividend policies and their implications for valuation. The course uses a mix of theory and practice for exposition.

First, we will chronologically study the various decades of post-independence politics. Second, we will study the big themes of Indian politics such as: parties, class, identity (caste, religion, region, gender), nationalism, economics, foreign policy, as well as leadership. The course is an introduction to Indian politics so no pre-requisites are necessary.

What historical, political, and cultural assumptions are at play in both the production and reception of texts? What texts should we be reading, and how? And for that matter, what is a “text,” anyway? There is no one answer to any of these questions, and how we answer them often depends on other matters: assumptions about what makes for good criticism, historical conditions of production, as well as our basic material circumstances as embodied selves. “Theory” can sometimes seem abstract to the point of being obscurantist, but while these judgments might be valid, they are themselves rooted in specific theoretical positions. To that end, one of the main objectives of this course will be to practice reading, writing, and speaking the idiom of theory, both in order to grow as critics and to enter into dialogue with others.

What counts as literature? What is the role of history in the production of literature? Does literature reflect reality or create it? Does gender play a role in the kind of literature we read and write? Why do we desire to read? What do we read when we read? In this class we will be working in theory’s self-reflexive spirit: reading and writing about texts that think about reading and writing. Even though its antecedents stretch as far back as Plato, we will be focusing primarily on several schools of literary thought from the 19th century to the present. The premise in all these theories is that literature is not a transparent medium; rather, we need to work hard in order to read, think, and write.

This reflected in their imperial titles like Jahangir (Conqueror of the World), Shah Jahan (King of the World), and Alamgir (Conqueror of the Universe). However, how much power did they actually wield? How did they use paintings and architecture to articulate their grand visions of power? What role did war, diplomacy, ideology, and religion play in the process of imperial expansion? These are some of the questions we will engage with. This course offers a comprehensive introduction to Mughal history and historiography. We will explore how the legacy of Chinghiz Khan and Amir Timur Gurgan shaped the empire in South Asia. We will look into the ideals of masculinity that animated Mughal courtly etiquette and study the role of Mughal women in court society. We will investigate how the empire legitimised its rule, disciplined its elite, and created its fabled riches. Finally, we will study why such a huge and prosperous empire fragmented away in the eighteenth century.

We will see how thinking of and with performance can help us investigate social behaviour, individual and collective identity, and embodied knowledge. We will situate the discipline of performance studies within its historical context in the late-twentieth century and trace its development through early twenty-first century. The course will focus on three recurring themes: the relationship between representation and performance, which will help us understand social behaviour; the paradigm of performativity, which is significant to theorizing identity; and the debate between whether performance is an ephemeral or enduring phenomenon, which is central to conceptualizing embodied knowledge. We will see, in short, how performance—as object, method, and analytic—can help us understand societies and cultures by focusing on acts of doing, ways of being, and modes of knowing. We will read JL Austin, Diana Taylor, Richard Schechner, Victor Turner, Uma Chakravarti, Susan Sontag, Erving Goffman, Judith Butler, Clifford Geertz, Sharmila Rege, Richard Bauman, Ngugi wa Thiong’o, Aparna Dharwadker, and Paulla Ebron.

Butterfly, Anna Deavere Smith’s Fires in the Mirror, and Mahesh Dattani’s Dance like a Man.

Not much, you might think. On the contrary, quite a lot. Even when they are vastly different from each other in politics, whether left or right-wing, radical or conservative, highly organized or very diffused, they are all examples of social movements. It is quite likely that you are often asked to tweet, friend, like or donate for some social cause. That is because social movements are propelled by the rhetoric and politics of emotions. It is true that intense emotions like those of anger, fear, disgust, love, empathy or grief are habitually invoked for social mobilizations and persuasion by most populist leaders. To study rhetoric and social movement therefore, is to study how dissent from poor and working-class people, women, people of color, LGBTQ activists, the disabled, immigrants, and other incompatible voices, come together in diverse ways to aid in building justice.

This Lab-2 course will be a little bit more advanced compared to Lab-1. The experiments (list is given below) are chosen in such a way that they would help the students to understand the theoretical concepts taught in the classroom lectures. Lab-2 will have the following experiments broadly based on the principles of classical mechanics and electromagnetism. 1. Kater's Pendulum (to determine the acceleration due to gravity) 2. Air Track (to study conservation of momentum and energy) 3. Free Fall 4. Electromagnetic Damping 5. Equipotential Curves 6. Electronics Circuits (LCR Bridge) The following experiments will be added should there be any unforeseen problems in any of the above mentioned experimental set up. 1. Ballistic Galvanometer 2.

My view is that literature can be more productively studied when literary and legal materials are placed next to each other. This approach does not treat law as the taken-for-granted backdrop that students already know, but instead makes explicit the similarities and differences between the two areas. What you have already learned about the law in other classes (no prerequisites required!) is not inevitably alien to the qualities of literary writing and analysis. In that way, the course is designed to show how legal modes of thought are sometimes already present in literary texts and vice versa. To that end, my syllabus combines literary readings, literary criticism, judicial opinions, and legal scholarship. Questions we will ask: How does literature use or respond to legal structures, themes, and analytical techniques, and vice versa? How does literature portray legal institutions and processes? What can literature bring to the performance of legal tasks, including legal narrative? To what extent can literary critical accounts of narrative structure and coherence explain the role of narrative in law, and where do these accounts fall short? What is achieved and what is missed by positing literature as law’s “other” (e.g., as the imaginative and ethical alternative to legal rules and constraints)? We will take up various problems at the intersection of law and literature: legal fictions, forms of legal writing and explanation, and the regulation of literature through copyright law. Next we will focus on two legal problems that have also occupied literary thinkers: the problem of criminal responsibility and literature’s ability to document human thought and motives, and the question of privacy in criminal law, tort law, and fiction. Afterwards, we will explore the concept of jurisdiction, terra nullius, and crown land. We will end by considering possible future directions for law and literature. Reading list includes Dorian Gray, The Importance of Being Earnest, Dr. Jekyll and Mr. Hyde, The Round House, and The House of the Vampire.

Entwined with questions of subjectivity, identity, paranoia, and death, this course will think through the relationship between desire and film. Who desires what, when, and where? Is there an I that desires, or is the I constituted by desire? What is the relation of the I to the eye? How does film as a medium generate desire in ways that might make it distinct from novels, poems, or plays? What role does representation play on the screen and in allowing us to recognise desire? How and why do we desire some films more than others? This course will think through films like Pedro Almodovar's Bad Education, Sanjay Leela Bhansali's Ram-Leela, and Maimouna Ducoure's Cuties, and theoretical texts by Kaja Silverman, Mary Ann Doane, and Leo Bersani, among others.

This is an elective course in advanced macroeconomics that will cover various issues related to the conduct of monetary policy and fiscal policy. The Global Financial Crisis highlighted how important an understanding of the banking sector is for macroeconomic policy makers. The first part of this course will study a simple question...What is money? After briefly studying the economic justifications for money we will study how the introduction of a banking sector influences monetary policy behaviour. We will then apply this theory to develop a coherent story of the Global Financial Crisis and the attendant monetary policy responses. The second part of the course will take a look at fiscal policy making and government debt dynamics. We will then apply the theories studied to understand sovereign debt crises, e.g. the Eurozone Crisis that followed the Global Financial Crisis.

And how does this inform macroeconomic policy? This course will provide an in-depth introduction to modern macroeconomic models of business cycles. We begin with a study of the canonical Real Business Cycle model – its assumptions, formulation, and solution methods. We cover the extensions needed to deal with the shortcomings of the canonical model with respect to labour markets and real dynamics. These extensions will cover various leading macroeconomic theories of labour markets, investment and consumption. Finally, we will study the extensions of the canonical model needed to account for the dynamics of nominal variables. The policy implications of these models will be studied throughout.

We will attempt to understand why, despite the cultural, linguistic and historical differences between the two, Shakespeare’s plays have been repeatedly adapted and reimagined in Hindi and other regional Indian cinemas. This will entail thinking about “masala” not just as a B-grade form of entertainment but also as a critical mode of engagement with – even a theoretical practice of – a plural society. How does Shakespeare approached through the lens of masala, and masala understood through the lens of Shakespeare, allow us to theorize the syncretic, the plural, the impure, and the mixed in ways that go beyond familiar postcolonial theories of hybridity? Plays to be considered: Comedy of Errors, Taming of the Shrew, A Midsummer Night's Dream, Romeo and Juliet, Macbeth, Othello, and Titus Andronicus; films to be considered: Angoor, Isi Life Mein, 10ml Love, Goliyon ki Rasleela Ram-Lila, Maqbool, Omkara, and The Hungry.

The Course MAT 1000 titled Calculus is offered every semester by the Mathematics Department. It is mandatory for all students who wish to take Mathematics as their major, minor or concentration subject. It is a prerequisite for most other courses in mathematics. It may also be required for other mathematics-intensive subjects.It is designated as an ""enabler"" course. Students are advised to take it as early as possible.  2.The course is designed for students who have done Mathematics in their Classes 11 and 12 in school. That means they have already learnt some calculus. College level calculus is quite different with its emphasis on concepts, rigour and reasoning in addition to calculations based on some standard techniques. Students should be prepared for this jump.  3. A few students who have not done Class 11 and 12 mathematics request that they may be allowed to take this course. At this time the Department allows this possibility. The following paras are addressed to students who wish to try this. (a)  This is going to be very difficult but not impossible. It will work out only if you learn and master some topics of school mathematics before the course begins. You may need an intensive four to six months of study to achieve this. (b) For your guidance a list of such topics is given below i. Algebra:  linear equations, quadratic equations, binomial theorem, sets and functions, graphs of functions, elementary functions like x^n, exponential and logarithmic functions, arithmetic and geometric progressions.  ii. Trigonometry: the sin, cos and tan functions, their basic properties, trigonometric identities, addition formulas iii. Coordinate Geometry: Equations of straight lines, circles, and other curves, slopes and tangents. At different points the course will draw on these topics and if you do not know them, you will find it very difficult to proceed. 4. To decide whether you are reasonably prepared you could look at a standard college level textbook. One such book is Calculus by James Stewart. Some of these books discuss the prerequisites for a Calculus course and also give some tests to check whether a student is reasonably well prepared. You will find other resources on the web. It is recommended that you test yourself and decide whether you are prepared.  Syllabus: Number systems. Sequences and series. Functions of a real variable. Graphs of functions. Limits and continuity. Differentiation. Mean value theorem. L’Hospital rule. Maclaurin and Taylor series. Curve tracing. Riemann integral. Definite and indefinite integrals. Fundamental theorem of calculus. Applications of differential and integral calculus in areas such as optimization and mechanics. References: J. Stewart: Calculus, Cengage Publishers, 2012.K. A.

Applications will include oligopoly, externalities, public goods, auctions and problems arising from asymmetric information.

And in deciding that future, the experience of India will loom large. This course explores the preceding proposition, examining ideas of political theory in relation to modern India’s history. How have concepts of democracy, nation, rights, citizenship, and global order shaped India, and how has the Indian experience in turn altered them? The aim of the course is to provide an introduction to modern India’s political thinking while at the same time challenging our understanding of core political ideas. Modern India is constituted through some of the most intricate and intense debates in recent political history - arguments about identity and difference, representation and dignity, individuality and communitarianism, justice and inequality, freedom and power. We will consider these debates, and also the practices and institutions (sometimes innovative, often flawed) to which they have given rise. The course offers a historically grounded approach to the study of Indian political thinking, while also examining normative political ideals in a comparative context, in order to clarify these ideals.

Here, museums are considered as a tool of cultural and political domination through knowledge production and the creation of authoritative pasts. We explore the history of museums in the context of colonial rule, the rise of independent nation-states, and the heritage and identity politics of contemporary South Asia. How did museums emerge in South Asia? What are the different museum forms in the region? Who is making them, why and when? What is their notion of heritage and whose heritage do they represent? A history of museums in South Asia is especially interesting as the region has a history, simultaneously, of a shared culture and of competing interests among its constituting national and social groups. We discuss examples of museums from Pakistan, India, Nepal, Bangladesh and Sri Lanka, and examine the dynamic ways in which politics, identity, religion, memory, history and heritage interact in the institution of the museum.  Theme 1: What is a Museum? In the introductory section to the course, we engage with the idea of the ‘museum’: what do we consider a museum; what would we not consider a museum; why do we create museums; and why do we visit them?  Theme 2: The Birth of the Museum in the West A brief overview of museum collections, as they emerged in Europe: cabinets of curiosity, Renaissance collections, princely collections during the age of explorations and through colonial activity, and during the emergence of nation-states. We particularly explore the role of museums in generating knowledge, as a tool of domination of non-western cultures, and a medium of creating a ‘national’ public in western societies. Theme 3: Colonial Collecting This section discusses museum activity in South Asia during colonial rule. How were the people and material culture of South Asia collected, classified and exhibited under colonial rule? We critically examine the collections amassed by colonial officers; the earliest museum collections of natural history, religious and archaeological artefacts; the formation of the Indian Museum, Kolkata as a grand project of the colonial government in India; the growth of the institution of the museum in relationship with the practice of archaeology; and the role of the colonial museum, in the political economy of the industrial exhibitions and world fairs in 19th century Europe. The case studies include the Indian Museum, Kolkata, the Lahore Museum, Pakistan, provincial museums in South India, representations of the Andaman Islands, and colonial collecting in Tibet. Theme 4: Local Efforts in Museum Building Besides the colonial rulers, a number of museums were developed by local scholarly societies (such as, the Bangiya Sahitya Parishad active in the Bengal region), and princely states like Baroda. These collections, on the one hand, made use of western ‘scientific’ practices of scholarship, collection and display, and on the other hand, were used by the local scholars to forge a regional identity and a national heritage, often challenging the colonial notion of the Indian past.  Theme 5:  National heritage, identity and social memory This section explores the history of museums in context of transition of South Asia, from a region under colonial rule, to a number of independent nation states. How did the South Asian countries envision their respective ‘national’ museums? How were museums used to forge new and distinct national identities and heritages? What aspects of a nation’s history were glorified and which memories suppressed? This is especially discussed in relation to varying representations (or the lack thereof) of the region’s common past, such as the Buddhist heritage in Pakistan and India, the Islamic past shared by Pakistan, India and Bangladesh, and the Partition in 1947. We also study museums in context of contemporary identity politics within the South Asian countries. Which museums in contemporary South Asia which challenge the national narrative of their respective nation-states? Who is building these and why? How do the marginalised and displaced communities use museums to preserve social memory and represent their heritage? This section discusses case studies from Pakistan (Lahore Museum), India (National Museum, New Delhi; the museum for Bhopal Gas Tragedy victims; Sikh museums), Sri Lanka (assassination museums), Nepal (Republic Memorial; Narayanhiti Palace Museum, Kathmandu), Bangladesh (Bangladesh Liberation War Museum), the exiled Tibetan community in Dharamsala, and their politics of representation. Theme 6: Religion in Museums Many collections in museums both in South Asia and the West consist of items which have religious value for the communities to which they belong. This section examines the interaction between religious practices of South Asian communities and the institution of the museum. How do religious objects get transformed into ‘secular’ artefacts in a museum? How do audiences respond to religious objects in museum displays? Are museums on religious history possible? Can museums also be sacred shrines? How do religion and history interact in an ‘objective’ and ‘secular’ museum space? We discuss these questions through an examination of Sikh museums, the practice of yoga in museums, and Buddhist relics and Hindu deities in museum collections.

A little knowledge of physics and mathematics may be helpful, but too much knowledge is likely to be a hindrance. Students will be required to solve problems and make presentations in the class.

One may imagine a firm as a web of social and economic ties in which several players make many decisions day in day out. For instance, workers decide how much effort to put in their work; managers decide who to promote and hire; firm owners decide whether to give managers any decision-making power. In this course, we will look at these decisions through the lens of an economist. Doing so will help us gain insight into the behavior of these individuals in a unique economic setting. We will discuss classical contributions and more recent developments (such as leadership, innovation and creativity, and discrimination and preferential treatment). We will cover topics ranging from personnel economics to the theories of the boundaries of the firms. While we will predominantly discuss theoretical studies, we will also look at some relevant empirical and experimental literature. A basic grasp of game theory is a prerequisite.

Over forty years ago, Edward Said energized the fields of literary theory, cultural criticism and postcolonial scholarship with Orientalism, arguing that generations of inaccurate, clichéd and self-serving portrayals of 'the East' by 'the West' had rationalised imperialism and hegemony. In this course, we will follow Said's lead in considering key junctures and tropes within that history, but will remain attentive to the ways in which the basic opposition of orient and occident, East and West, might not just be enacted but also blurred and disturbed by the workings of desire and kinship; by the complexity and heterogeneity of engagement; by translation, transgression and transformation. Our readings will reach into particular moments from the 18th century to the present, taking in the birth of orientalist scholarship, Romantic orientalism and 19th century comparative orientalisms, as well as more contemporary representations. We will read novels, shorter fiction, poems, oriental tales and translations by British and European writers including (but not only) Johann Wolfgang von Goethe, the Romantic poets, Gustave Flaubert, Oscar Wilde, and George Eliot; 19th century European philosophers and philologists; visual texts drawn from the history of painting and the movies; and theorists including Said, Michel Foucault, Gayatri Chakraborty Spivak, Aijaz Ahmad, James Clifford and Sara Suleri.

Are we made stronger by surviving adversity? Are we made empathetic through a first-hand experience with challenge? Do we demonstrate resilience from managing hardships? Is there a synthesis of existing contradictions? Is there a redemption from past shortcomings? Is there a fulfillment of unrealized potential? These and related questions draw our attention to the political importance of overcoming as a personal or collective project: there is some sort of power manifest in pushing beyond what otherwise might have held us back. In this course, we will read a variety of material dealing with politics, philosophy, literature, psychology, sociology, history, etc., and ask ourselves what various materials might tell us about overcoming, what is overcome, what happens as a result of overcoming, etc. Themes may include the dialectic, repression, translation, authority, expression, exclusion, and, perhaps, pandemic.

Starting with a historical introduction and motivation, it goes on to introduce probability amplitudes as the fundamental physical basis for QM. Using the Dirac bra-ket notation, the fundamental postulates are then introduced and their consequences worked out. The basic physical concepts are illustrated through spin-½ systems and one-dimensional wave mechanics. Symmetries and Conservation laws in QM are discussed, an introduction to the basic theory of angular momentum and spin is given, and the course culminates with the first major triumph of QM - a quantum mechanical understanding of the hydrogen atom. Recommended course content: Review of linear algebra in the context of QM. Postulates. Uncertainty Principle. Ehrenfest Theorem. Wave mechanics in one dimension. The one-dimensional harmonic oscillator. Symmetries, angular momentum. Spin-½ systems,  Stern-Gerlach experiments.  Hydrogen Atom Pre-requisites: Classical Mechanics, Mathematical Physics II Recommended: Linear Algebra (Department of Mathematics). Taught at the level of: Principles of Quantum Mechanics (R Shankar), Introduction to Quantum Mechanics (D J Griffiths).

And this requires the cultivation of an eye-for-nuance both in the performer as well as the reader/viewer or the rasika. Beginning with the Rasa theory as delineated by Bharata in the Natya Shastra, the readings will then revolve around the poetic discourse that emerged towards the end of the 1st millennium; particularly the Pratibjijna theory of “Recognition,” as well as the writings of Abhinavagupta, who quite literally radicalises Indian poetics by adding the ninth rasa, i.e. santa.  Apart from looking at the linguistic debates regarding the purpose of poetry, i.e. whether it is for instruction, pleasure or composure, the course will mainly focus on the paradoxical constructs and ethos of sacred-erotic poetry.

The course will be an integrated whole and seek to develop a nuanced view of the transitions, contests and transformation in polity and society from the provincial elections of 1937 till the general elections of 1977 and the first democrartic transfer of office in independent India at the federal level. The course looks at the relation of political social and changes in India correlating internal and external developments. it commences with the victory of the Congress in the provincial polls and concludes with its rout in the 1977 Lok Sabha polls. Among the issues examined are World War II and India, for instance its relation to Partition. The changing equations of regions and the emerging nation state, the making of the linguistic states and the rise of economic planning and its early crises. The Congress and its critics get attention as do the debates on environment, technology and science.  The course correlates and locates these changes in a wider context: the end of empire and decolonization;  the Cold War and Sino Soviet split in Asia, and their relation to South Asia. Often as in the case of the wars of 1947 or 1962 or 1971 these conflicts had important domestic political implications as well.   The  transfromation of the Indian economy under planning and the criris end 1960s too cast a shadow .India's emergence as a regional power by the end of the 1971 war and the 1974 explosion at Pokhran had elements of both change and continuity with the past.So the course spans history, politics and international relations and encourages informed and critical thinking on an exciting period of the recent past. The fabled 'Congress system' was in crisis by 1967 and the party and polity remade by Mrs Gandhi soon thereafter by 1971-72. The aftermath of 1972-73 led to serious challenges and the Emergency of 1975-77. The course also pays considerbale attention ot regional histopries including the south and North East.

Why, for instance, is it safer for women to walk on the streets of Mumbai rather than Sonepat? And why is the average Botswanian healthier than the average resident of Somalia? The course begins by studying different definitions of “development”. It then looks at the various explanations for development, from political institutions to economic growth to cultural mores to leadership. Towards the end of the course, we will study examples of change and reform.

Is it somewhat redundant to do so? This course begins with such questions but moves beyond, to read certain postcolonial literary texts as not only physically rooted in material spaces – often poor, backward and non-modern spaces – but also examines how they embody the spirit of such locations, often untranslatable and un-exportable. Here, we will come together to explore if the universal could be sought in the most sensory embodiment of the particular, including stories from “backward and provincial” spaces or if it is to be identified more easily in the symbolism reinforced by colonial and neocolonial languages of modernity.

Snapshots of this approximately two thousand-year history are traced through definitive genres such as stone and copper plate inscriptions, letters, biographies and autobiographies.

Issues of interest to students of history, such as orality and materiality, literary and visual aesthetic traditions, courtly cultures, circulatory networks of merchants and monks, and perhaps most importantly, the articulations of historical consciousness, are highlighted in this course.                        Programme Interested InUndergraduate ProgrammeYoung India FellowshipYSPPhDMA - EconomicsMA EnglishMSC Biology Year of Admission2022-232023-242024-252025-26  Subscribe to our communications [current_url]     Plot No. 2, Rajiv Gandhi Education City, National Capital Region P.O.

Starting with the rules of observation and description and ending with the techniques of interpretation of collected information, this course will cover the various steps a scholar canonically follows to do research: from the formulation of a research question to defining a problematic, from collecting secondary sources to conducting first field observations, from drawing a research design to do fieldwork and conduct interviews, to analyze the material collected to finally writing. The main outcome of this course is the writing of a full-fledged research paper. This course also aims at introducing you to two streams of scholarship. One from the past: village studies, or a questioning about rural or agrarian change in India. One more contemporary: the anthropology of politics. India’s villages remain often portrayed as immutable locations, disconnected from the forces of change that are reshaping India. Far from the truth, India’s villages are undergoing profound transformations, altering or reconfiguring social relations between individuals and communities. We will revisit some of the classic work in India’s village studies, and notably the contributions of one of India’s most eminent sociologist, M.N. Srinivas.

Here are just a handful of questions that you can answer using qualitative methods: How do Ashoka University students perceive their experiences in relations to Delhi University students? What was the impact of COVID on migrant workers? How are the experiences of upper-caste women different from that of Dalit women? How do employees at an organization perceive their bosses in corporate organizations?

Conceptualized as an introductory course on the study of material remains from various parts of the world (with a strong emphasis on India), it is divided into two broad sections. The first explores fine-tuned methods employed by archaeologists to analyze available data in the reconstruction of the past; major theoretical turns in the history of the discipline; the relationship between history and archaeology; and the specialized branches of epigraphy and numismatics. The second section engages with scholarly but accessible accounts of archaeological cultures from Europe and Africa. While the first half of the course will be a combination of lectures and discussions, the remaining half will be completely discussed-based.

Gandhi, Walter Benjamin, Hannah Arendt, Simone de Beauvoir, and Rachel Carson. Students who take the course will, through close analysis of primary texts and contextual and historical study, gain an understanding and appreciation of some of that century’s most influential ideas and theories, considered through a variety of interpretative frameworks.  Themes and tensions that will be explored include: the relationship between the pursuit of totalizing theories of mind, society, evolution, and recognition of the fragmented character of modern experience; the effects of encounters between western power and non-western cultures; the relationship between humans and nature; the politics of gender; and arguments for rationality and its limits.  Throughout, we will take seriously reading in both its senses: reading as interpretation as well as, literally, the activity of reading itself - students taking the course can expect to do a fair amount of reading, mainly of primary texts. Supplemental material in the form of video and audio recordings (to be posted on the classroom webpage), will be also be used.  Course assessment will be on the basis of five ‘Reading notes’ (@400 words each) on the set texts (50% of course assessment), and one long essay (2000 words).  Summary of Sessions  Week 1.

But what does respect in a situation of equality mean? Afterall, the logic of respect may very well depend on hierarchy: we respect that which is high and not that which is low, for if we respected the low as well as the high then “respect” would be meaningless. This course is an exploration of the challenges of thinking through the politics of equal respect when the meaningfulness of “respect”—and perhaps related terms like “honor” and “dignity”—appears to presume, i.e. to derive meaningfulness from, inequality. In our effort to work through the relationship among respect, hierarchy, and equality we will consider issues involving international spaces, regional locations, identity’s differences, economic distibution, and so forth while drawing upon a wide variety of scholarship that includes philosophy, politics, economics, anthropology, sociology, psychology, and history.

Crucially, it has become the principal arbiter of every aspect of human life, defining what is natural and what is rational. Power itself is now exercised, as never before in history, through scientific expertise and the use of science to transform material, economic, cultural, environmental and biological aspects of our lives. Science is thus both the emblem of Modernity and the yardstick for measuring economic and social development internationally. A historical study of the dynamics of science as a social institution and its stakes in global, national and local politics is thus indispensable for an understanding of the contemporary world. In the guise of a guided tour of the transformations in the global geo-political and intellectual landscape from turn of the 20th century to the present, this course traces the concomitantly changing images of science, and the (re)writing of its history as a purely Western phenomenon. It also introduces the key concepts of the interdisciplinary field of the history, anthropology, sociology and philosophy of science as they emerged in this process. It thus provides a toolkit for thinking critically about the place of science and other knowledge practices in contemporary societies. Owing to the interdisciplinary nature of the subject and a case-based approach, this course is ideally suited to students from both humanities and sciences.     1) The 20th Century: Distinguishing science from non-science — emergence of the History and Philosophy of Science as disciplines. 2) 1913-1939: Whose science is the history of science the history of? From early 20th-century Humanism to Soviet Marxism, to the Scientific Revolution, and the European origins of “universal” science. 3) 1945-1970: Western Science, its history and relationship to the non-West; a strategic tool of the Superpowers in a bipolar “Cold War” world. 4) 1970s-2000: New Objects, New Approaches, New Questions in the Post-1968 World — From intellectual history to the case-study: Sociology, Anthropology, Geography, Gender and Empire enter Science Studies. 5) 2000-2020: Re-introducing the World into the history of science. New concepts and chronologies.

In addition, we will analyse policy in three types of rural markets: reforms in the market for land, microfinance initiatives, and publicly funded insurance policies. Finally, we will consider the nature of social exclusion in India, with a special focus on caste.Through its interactive discussion-based format, as well as by giving you the opportunity of engaging in a substantive empirical research project, this course hopes to give you a deep dive into understanding how economic principles interplay with social forces to shape the Indian development experience.

However, often the distinction is not so simple and wide ranges of systems seem to fall between the solid and liquid phase! For example, look at our skin; should we consider it as solid, or liquid? The screen of our smartphone and other similar display units; are they solid or liquid? They all fall under the domain of soft matter. In this course of Soft Matter Physics, we will study some of the physical principles governing the characteristic behavior of different soft matter systems. This course will equip you with the fundamentals of soft matter, and also fulfil your immediate research needs in relevant fields.

The American critic Harold Bloom believed that, with this play, Shakespeare invented “the human”. Rather than focusing on the human, however, this course takes up the play’s distinctive obsession with something non-human or post-human – the figure of the ghost or spectre, the revenant who comes back from the dead past to haunt the present and the future. We will attempt to tease out the resonances of this obsession in the play’s literary and generic contexts (revenge tragedy, including Kyd’s Spanish Tragedy and Middleton’s Revenger’s Tragedy), its historical and religious contexts (outlined by Stephen Greenblatt in Shakespeare in Purgatory), and its extraordinary afterlives in drama (The Skinhead Hamlet, Tom Stoppard’s Rosencrantz and Guildenstern Are Dead), fiction (Ian McEwan’s Nutshell), film (Laurence Olivier’s Hamlet, Grigor Kosintsev’s Gamlet, Vishal Bhardwaj’s Haider), and critical theory (Marx’s Communist Manifesto, Freud’s Interpretation of Dreams, Lacan’s Desire in Hamlet, Derrida’s Specters of Marx, Edelman’s Against Survival, Schmitt’s Hamlet or Hecuba). Supplementing the latter with contemporary criticism (from Elaine Showalter and Jacqueline Rose to Marjorie Garber and Terence Hawkes), we will try to understand the figure of the revenant as not simply a theme of Shakespeare’s play but also a repetition compulsion that animates and even demands Hamlet’s many reimaginings.

Right from its inception, with Dadasaheb Phalke’s Raja Harishchandra (1913), it has shaped the public narrative in India. While the themes of Hindi films have changed over the years -- from the patriotic Mother India to the sports-feminist Dangal, the presentation of nationalism, sports and sexualities may just be old wine in new bottles.  We will also explore how the language, fashion, music, dance, and social values embedded in Bollywood films are disseminated. International theoretical readings from ideas of nationalism, film, gender, class, and cultural studies, and literature from various parts of the world will underpin our discussions of Bombay’s film industry and our exploration of the values and ideologies embedded in apparently innocent entertainment. One of the course’s goals is to recognize these themes and develop the analytical tools to effectively “read” a text/film, empowering us to identify challenge mainstream norms.

Entwined with questions of subjectivity, identity, paranoia, and death, this course will think through the relationship between desire and film. Who desires what, when, and where? Is there an I that desires, or is the I constituted by desire? What is the relation of the I to the eye? How does film as a medium generate desire in ways that might make it distinct from novels, poems, or plays? What role does representation play on the screen and in allowing us to recognise desire? How and why do we desire some films more than others? This course will think through films like Pedro Almodovar's Bad Education, Sanjay Leela Bhansali's Ram-Leela, and Maimouna Ducoure's Cuties, and theoretical texts by Kaja Silverman, Mary Ann Doane, and Leo Bersani, among others.

A more affect-driven and less historic, partition in lower case, imbues a range of articulations - graphic novels, cinema, art, painting, and of course literature. This course is interested in navigating the terrain of affect and partition through discussions on language; space; geographies but by focusing almost entirely on cinema. This provides the course focus on both the historical backdrop in the background; as well as the slow-moving processes of memory and lexicon-making that partition has affected. This course must be taken only if both things; partition and cinema interest students. We will watch films that foreshadow partition such as Padoson, to those that show the cleavages of self and community after partition (Garam Hawa), but also discuss the embedded sentiment of partition in themes of lost and found or broken families; and in more recent times, Salman Khan films such as Bajrangi Bhaijaan.

Was there always an “India”? This course begins with these questions and takes students through milestone moments of literature-making. Traversing different genres and languages from ancient times to the present day, the scope of this course is vast, for it has the provision of including a Buddhist nun’s verses from the sixth century BCE to Khalid Jawed’s The Paradise of Food (translated from Urdu by Baran Farooqi; awarded the JCB Prize in 2022). Clearly, it is not possible to expose the students to this entire range. However, the course aims to kindle profound interest in the intersections of languages and themes, the forms and genres that characterise the loosely named body called “Indian literature/s.” We will go from the ancient to medieval, colonial to modern and postcolonial body of writing—sometimes in detail, sometimes not. It would be difficult to say what gives unity, if any, to this body and whether this “body” is discursively formed through its users who read literature from Indian languages in English. The course examines the politics around such archives and the interrelationship between English and the bhashas. While the politics of language and translation underpin the instructor’s theoretical approach, the course is committed to understanding the questions of history, region, community, caste, and region-making politics in India.   Week 1:  Introduction  Week 2: Bharti, Dharamvir.

But can storytelling bring about political revolutions? Is it possible for stories to stand up against colonial abuse, fight prejudices, bring social change, impact public policy? In this course, we will talk about stories that did exactly that and did it so spectacularly that generations have remained in awe of them. We will read novels, short stories, memoirs and essays to discover that each of these works of art were responsible for protesting against the political injustices of their times.

Symmetry is a fundamental concept throughout physics, be it particle physics and field theory, condensed matter physics, cosmology, quantum mechanics/quantum information or atomic and molecular physics. The basic concepts of geometrical symmetry,  finite groups and their representations will be covered. A physically oriented  introduction will be given to Lie algebras and Lie groups and their representations. The emphasis throughout will be on the particular rather than the general. Familiar concepts from quantum mechanics will be used repeatedly - for example, the hydrogen atom spectrum and its symmetries will arise repeatedly during the study of Lie groups. Rather than develop the general theory of semi-simple compact Lie groups, the important concepts will be illustrated through particular examples. For example, the groups SO(2), SO(3), SU(2), SU(3) etc. as they arise in physics and their unique and distinctive features and representations.  Pre-requisites: Quantum Mechanics References: Group theory in a nutshell for physicists, by A.

The jungle of Africa as imagined by Edgar Rice Burroughs, the American creator of Tarzan (who incidentally never set foot in Africa), was influenced among other things by British author Rudyard Kipling's Jungle Book and the man-cub Mowgli's capers (1894). Translated into several languages, these allegorical tales of British empire in Africa and India filtered into popular consciousness through comic books and cinematic reproductions. Tarzan's and Mowgli's adventures became the most enduring globally-circulating images of interaction between white men with the non-white world. These stories open a door into the cultural world of colonial India, Africa, Britain and USA. Through them the course explores the different ways in which the human societies engaged with the ‘Other’ and, in doing so, reconstituted each other. This cultural dialogue was evident, as the students will discover, especially in the way colonialism sought to colonize the mind, body, history, culture, geography and the aesthetic sensibilities of the people of Empire, and also in the way it reconfigured the British and American sense of nationhood. The course will examine these themes in depth to bring to fore the lived ‘experience’ of the period between 1870s and the First World War.

This historical tour will be grounded in a framework for understanding development: how have geography, history and institutions influenced the trajectory of nations? What has been the role of states and markets? How have ideas, interests, institutions, inheritances and individuals interacted in the course of economic history? Over the last few decades, and especially after the COVID-19 pandemic, should we think about development as compartmentalized between distinct geographies?

What are they trying to govern, and how well do they succeed? Do the laws come from among the desires they govern, or do they tower over them? Does literature respond to the language of the law or does it provide that language? How do we read the law? Does reading literature help us understand or resist the law?

We will begin each segment through a primary source workshop involving an examination of the ephemera of the past such as the newspaper reportage, cartoon, paintings, advertisements, film posters along with regional literature, oral histories, memoirs, theatre and cinema of the period along with etc. This will be followed by a discussion on the prescribed readings that introduce to new ways of understanding their past. The students are expected to have read a novel and seen a film from each of the decades.

We refer to it routinely when, for example, we observe that we are ruled by laws rather than by people or when we say that no person is above the law. But what precisely does the “rule of law” mean? This course will address this question by considering a range of readings in political and legal theory. It will consider canonical interpretations and accounts of this ideal, such as those offered by thinkers like Dicey, Hayek, and Fuller. It will explore debates on the nature of the concept, such as whether it is a substantive or formal ideal, address how the rule of law relates to matters such as welfare and crime, and how it applies in the context of courts, emergencies, and so on.

These are some of the questions this course addresses. It unravels military processes in South Asia between 1000 CE and 1800 CE in relation with broader social, political, and cultural processes. We will also study military matters related to technology, tactics, strategy, fortification, logistics, and military personnel. We will begin our journey in the early-11th century with the Chola kings of South India invading Southeast Asia and with North India facing Turko-Afghan invasions.We will stop at the end of the 18th century, with the English East India Company poised to become the dominant military power of the subcontinent. By the end of the semester, students will have a sound understanding of the workings of the world of war in medieval and early modern South Asia. In turn, this historical background will help students understand military and political processes of colonial and post-colonial South Asia better.                        Programme Interested InUndergraduate ProgrammeYoung India FellowshipYSPPhDMA - EconomicsMA EnglishMSC Biology Year of Admission2022-232023-242024-252025-26  Subscribe to our communications [current_url]     Plot No. 2, Rajiv Gandhi Education City, National Capital Region P.O.

The course introduces you to the framework and language used in economics to assess and understand the world around us. The course will help you answer the following questions using an economic framework. How do people make decisions? How to make sense of the decisions taken by people? How do you come up with a causal framework to understand a phenomenon? How do economists formulate and test a hypothesis? In which cases the markets provide the efficient outcome and where should governments intervene? Students will also be introduced to certain aspects of economic history, the role of economic institutions in governing the trajectory of economies and our lives, principles of decision making in a world marked by scarcity and strategic interaction. We will also go on to cover other topics, including discrimination, unemployment, inequality and poverty.

However, since the formation of the discipline, a lot of work has been done by translators and academics to push the envelope as to the politics this transfer of meaning might entail. Translation is not an innocuous linguistic act, but rife with power politics. This course aims to push its students towards thinking of translation as not simple a transfer of meaning, but an embodying of difference. It will attempt to inculcate in students a method reading that grounds itself in the politics of language. Furthermore, it will allow for students to look towards and embrace non-linguistics acts of translation as well. By the end of the course, students should be able to look beyond the readings prescribed on the various facets of translation and gather an understanding of not just what translation entails, but what it leaves out.

The scholar Roja Singh said, “We, as a human community are capable of finding solidarity in this increasing pandemic of racist and casteist sexual violence. We raise our collective voice – Dalit Lives Matter! […] We rise from their ashes as a regenerative international solidarity group – a global movement – a cry for restorative justice and human dignity justice for all.” Davis’s lecture and Singh’s statement are recent additions to a transnational dialogue between the struggles against race and caste that goes back nearly 150 years. This conversation has included WEB Du Bois’s theorization of the global “color line,” BR Ambedkar’s anti-caste vision rooted in universals of equality and humanity, ML King’s engagements with Gandhian thought, the Dalit Panthers finding inspiration and example in the Black Panthers, TM Yesudasan’s formulation of the Dalit “double consciousness” after Du Bois, and more recently, the explicit internationalist visions of Shailaja Paik, Suraj Yengde, Yashica Dutt, Nico Slate, and Isabel Wilkerson. Taking inspiration from these ongoing dialogues, this course examines the importance of transnational solidarities in struggles against race and caste. By analyzing the encounters, borrowings, and (mis)recognitions that characterize this transnational dialogue, we will identify shared thematics and chart their evolving relationships of sympathy and solidarity. This graduate seminar will discuss a range of material—archival sources, theoretical writing, drama, poetry, fiction, life writing, film, and music—to chart this exchange across historical archives and repertoires of embodied experience.

The design of social institutions (e.g., marriage, property rights, electoral systems, markets) and the way they function matter to every facet of our lives. Often, the outcomes depend on what game theorists call 'strategic' behaviour. This is just saying that our actions and choices are made keeping in mind the actions and choices of others. For instance, my decision to be a good citizen (in class, in life) may well depend on similar decisions by others. The outcome (e.g., pollution, global warming, traffic congestion, the spread of Covid) is the aggregate of each of these micro-decisions. Clearly these can be good or bad. Indeed, very often they are bad despite well intentioned policies. Why is that? In this course we aim to introduce multi-agent interactions using game theory. We will follow an example-based approach where intuitive reasoning would be provided to explain various phenomena as mentioned earlier. This would illuminate why co-operation can be hard and when it can be sustained. We will discuss, using examples, how one can circumvent the problem of inefficiency led by strategic interactions. Several applications from market and institution design such as voting, auctions and matching will be discussed. Further, it is interesting to model some of the observable characteristics in the biological kingdoms as strategic interactions. For instance, consider oak trees in a wood shading each other. If the surrounding trees are tall, then a tree must also grow tall to get more light. We will discuss how modeling such observations as games helps us understand evolutionary outcomes in phenotypic terms.

The course starts by developing a simple theory of cities and its implications for city size, firm productivity, and housing prices. It then studies evidence on the impact of cities on firm and worker productivity, urban amenities, and congestion. Finally, the course will study how to evaluate the effect of new infrastructure or policy on land and housing values and overall welfare, and conclude with a brief discussion about systems of cities and industrial clusters.

It is a seminar course in the global history of early modern warfare. It is geared towards intensive collective reading of and discussion on important monographs about the relationship between warfare and empire-building in the early modern world (c. 1500 – c. 1800). We will closely engage with ten different books in the thirteen weeks of this course. We will begin with an overview of the various early modern empires and by discussing some of the framing issues of global military history for this period. Throughout the course, we will focus on military tactics, strategy, technology, logistics, military culture and explore their connections with state-formation and empire-building in different parts of the world. As the course will progress, we will read books on Europe, colonial America, Russia, Africa, the Ottoman Empire, the Mughal Empire, the Ming and Qing Empires of China, Southeast Asia, and the Tokugawa shogunate of Japan.                       Programme Interested InUndergraduate ProgrammeYoung India FellowshipYSPPhDMA - EconomicsMA EnglishMSC Biology Year of Admission2022-232023-242024-252025-26  Subscribe to our communications [current_url]     Plot No. 2, Rajiv Gandhi Education City, National Capital Region P.O.

It immediately refers to the archipelagic characters of the mainland and island Southeast Asia, but it also draws attention to the centrality of oceans in connecting people across time and space. The oceans have historically brought together people from different continents, countries and contexts, similar to a single water body in a deep forest that unites all the animals there. On the waters and shores of the seas, many civilizations and cultures have risen and fallen, and thousands of humans have prospered and perished in their unsurmountable yet eternal ambition to control the oceanic wilderness. In this course, we explore the long histories of ocean-human entanglements, by looking at specific themes such as thalassophobia (fear of ocean), thalassophilia (love of ocean), thalassocracy (maritime state), along with diverse productions and circulations of knowledge systems and navigational practices. With a focus on the Indian Ocean bordering Asia, Africa and Australia and on a period between 800 and 1800 CE we shall see how the oceans dominated the human history. The course will introduce you to some foundational debates and issues in the fields of oceanic histories, and it will help you understand long histories that transcend national and continental borders and chronological brackets.

China’s sixteenth-century commercial revolution, in the context of the growing international trade in silver, transformed social and cultural life in every corner of society. Since then, arguments about the distribution of resources and the proper remedy for inequality have been central to political and social movements, especially during the twentieth century. In this course we will examine the economic bases of income inequality in Chinese history, investigate strategies Chinese governments and individuals have used to mitigate rural and urban poverty, and come to appreciate how these economic realities affected people at all levels of Chinese society. Wealth and poverty were experienced differently according to factors including (but not limited to) gender, age, level of education, disability, sexuality, ethnicity, and location. We will read primary sources which illuminate a wide range of perspectives and consider, in conversation with the secondary literature, how to synthesise these materials.

What it Justice? Is evil permitted in the service of the state? This course examines some of the canonical texts of the Western Political Tradition that were significant in shaping thinking about the normative political theory. Through these texts it will range over a number of important questions: the nature of political obligation, the ends of life, the relationship between virtue and politics, the nature of justice, property rights, the nature of the state, the nature of the self. The emphasis will be to come to terms with important arguments in these areas, while also understanding these major texts in their own right. This course equips you with the arguments and historical background for most of the debates in contemporary political thought as well.

Questions thus very often get reduced to explanations limited to national parameters without taking account of broader dynamics and relations. In the context of nations that gained independence from European colonialist in the post-WW II era, Postcolonial Studies have sought to engage with this nationalist framework by attempting to situate their histories especially during the colonial period as a process of resistance to European imperial domination and imposition of the latter’s outlook and values. However, a number of questions and issues are thus blindsided in this systematically agonistic perspective, or for that matter in its opposite, a free-flowing diffusionist model based on a simple-minded Whiggish model of progress. This course looks to go beyond this double-bind in order to examine a whole swathe of historical questions — migrations; the administration of imperial spaces; scientific, technological and cultural transfers; the formation of globalised elites; the construction of knowledge through processes of intercultural interaction … just a few examples of phenomena that traditional national historiographies are not tailored to confront. Based on case-studies from early-modern and modern history, this course will present and discuss different historiographical approaches to transnational and global processes, their fields of applicability, as well as their limitations: diffusionism, comparativism, connected, entangled, circulatory and cross-roads history, to name some of them. This course is ideally suited to students in the humanities and social sciences.

According to the seventeenth-century political theorist John Locke, our conception of public welfare had to expand beyond protecting and enforcing private transactions to conceptions of the common good, order, and access to roads and markets. Yet, as many of our greatest writers have noted, we only realize that our conceptions of justice have come to encompass public duties, health care, and infrastructure in moments of crises when roads fall into ruins and bodies succumb to pandemic. In this class, we come to these concepts through the literary tradition of the zone, which is an area of artificially supported trade and legality. The most recent example of the zone with which you may be familiar is the Green Zone in Iraq, but in actuality we are surrounded by “zones,” from downtown Chicago and downtown New York to Guantanamo Bay, Rajiv Gandhi Educational City, as well as most maritime ports. We imagine zones into reality, and they become crossroads of trade, military force, finance, and communication. We will focus on literary depictions of the zone, which are organized around figures such as zombies, highwaymen, castaways, survivors, and human commodities whose freedom is traded away in free trade zones – such as slaves and indentured servants. Reading list includes Zone One, One Flea Spare, Zoo City, A Journal of the Plague Year, The Female American, and The Corpse Washer.

The first is the Young India Fellowship (YIF), a one-year multidisciplinary diploma programme in Liberal Studies. Fellows then, have the option to pursue their Master’s in Liberal Studies (MLS) after graduating from the YIF. Fellows who have been accepted by an Ashoka University faculty mentor to work on a specific research project as a graduate assistant, stay back for an additional year to pursue their MA liberal arts. The programme is highly interdisciplinary and entails coursework from a variety of disciplines. Apart from this, Ashoka University’s Master’s programme in Economics has been developed to provide students with the opportunity to be trained in modern Economics by highly qualified economists. Applications opened for the first batch of Master’s in Economics students in February this year.       The Master of Arts (MA) programme in English at Ashoka University aims to occupy an important space in the current landscape of higher education in India. Many young scholars of literature and culture in India are contemplating studying these subjects at the PhD level, but have yet to be exposed to the liberal arts ethos and pedagogy. The MA programme in English will provide a unique intellectual experience for these students while carving out a much-needed path to higher studies abroad and in India.      Ashoka University’s Master’s programme in Economics has been developed to provide students the opportunity to be trained in modern Economics by highly qualified economists. Our approach to Economics is a comprehensive one. We believe in teaching students both how to ask and address questions that are informed by economic theory as well as how to substantiate their arguments with rigorous data analysis. The coursework in the programme has been designed with the latest research in mind and draws on some of today’s most exciting research fields. At the end of the programme, students are expected to have state-of-the-art quantitative skills valued both in academia and in the corporate world.     The Masters in Biology program at Ashoka University is designed to impart holistic training in the fundamentals of physical and chemical principles of biology, in the diverse yet connected areas ranging from evolution and organismal biology to cell-molecular and computational biology. This unique program allows students to customize their specialized learning based on individual interests. Students will learn through hands-on training aided by contemporary and innovative pedagogical methods as well as through extensive independent research.     The Master of Arts (MA) in Liberal Studies at Ashoka University is a 32-credit, one-year programme taken by students who have graduated with a diploma in Liberal Studies from the Young India Fellowship, and have been accepted by an Ashoka University faculty mentor to work on a specific research project as a graduate assistant. The programme is highly interdisciplinary and entails coursework from a variety of disciplines, including the humanities, social sciences, behavioural sciences and the natural sciences. The purpose of a Master of Arts in Liberal Studies is to train students to think critically about their disciplines of interest, while deriving insights from other disciplines. It also aims to help students who wish to pursue graduate studies to ground themselves in their discipline(s) of choice and to prepare their graduate application.

Ashoka’s intellectually vibrant campus provides students an opportunity to engage in cross-disciplinary learning and be informed by the views of leading political scientists, sociologists, psychologists, historians, mathematicians and computer scientists, amongst others. The campus is an ideal space where students can grow—intellectually as well as professionally. Within a very short period, Ashoka has been recognized as a leading innovator in Indian higher education. The Master’s programme in Economics provides students an opportunity to leverage Ashoka’s growing stature and expanding networks to shape their future careers, whether it be in academia or beyond.   The Ashoka approach to Economics is fundamentally about bringing together cutting-edge economic theory and rigorous data analysis to address questions at the frontiers of research. The Masters Programme in Economics has been developed with this perspective. It will provide students not only the opportunity to be trained by highly qualified economists but also to leverage Ashoka’s growing stature and expanding networks to shape their careers, whether it be in the academy or beyond. The Master of Arts in Economics programme is a two-year, four-semester programme. Students will study 7 compulsory courses and an elective in the first year and at least 8 electives (or its equivalent) in the second year. Before the beginning of the first semester, students will attend a mandatory Math Camp to brush up their quantitative skills. In the first year, students grow deep roots in the foundations of modern economics as they are provided with a rigorous introduction to microeconomics, macroeconomics and econometrics. In addition, they take a course which advances their understanding of quantitative techniques. This rigorous training prepares them for the more research-focused and specialised elective courses that they have to choose from in the second semester and later in their second year. The goal of these courses is to allow the students to develop an appreciation of what the current research frontier in economics looks like.    The course across the two years are: Math Camp is for 2 credits, while all remaining courses are for 4 credits. In the first year, students are introduced to the foundations of modern economics through rigorous coursework in microeconomics, macroeconomics and econometrics. In their second semester and over the second year, students pursue their academic interests across various sub-disciplines in economics using both theoretical, and empirical research methods.     The first batch of MA Economics students graduated in 2019. Since then, our students have been placed in several corporate and research firms. Many have gone on to pursue higher academic degrees as well.    MA Economics Academic Handbook      Ashoka University aims to help students become well-rounded individuals who can think critically about issues from multiple perspectives, communicate effectively and become leaders with a commitment to public service. An Ashoka education carries a strong emphasis on foundational knowledge, thorough academic research based on rigorous pedagogy, and hands-on experience with real-world challenges.     The MA Economics programme at Ashoka University was a truly transformational experience. The rigorous coursework, outstanding faculty and regular department seminars, broadened my understanding and appreciation of economics and its applications in the real-world. The small class size and close-knit community fostered a rich learning experience and enabled me to develop lasting relationships with both my batch-mates as well as professors. Today, I find that the key skills that have helped me in my current role, were in fact ones that I had honed during my two years at Ashoka, such as dealing with ambiguity through structured problem solving, working in diverse teams and under tight deadlines, and communicating in a coherent manner. Moreover, since graduating, the broader Ashoka alumni network has been really helpful from both a personal and professional standpoint, with its active, engaging and supportive community.

Our coursework allows for exposure to a wide array of texts, theories and disciplinary formations from around the world. MA students will also have the opportunity to pursue courses in other departments at Ashoka thus bringing new lenses to bear on literary studies. Above all, students will pursue their study of literature in relation to the larger world they live in and ask pertinent questions of it.  The MA English programme places a premium equally on rigorous critical thinking and in-depth research. This emphasis on rigour, alongside the other avenues for intellectual, professional and personal growth offered by Ashoka University, will better prepare students for a variety of career paths, including further study leading to a Ph.D., teaching at the high-school level, advertising, media, and law.      The MA in English is a two-year, four-semester programme. Students take a mixture of required courses, elective courses, Independent Study Modules, and electives from other programmes. Within the programme, students have the option of pursuing a concentration, and specializing in a particular field. They are also free to follow a general path of literary studies and can choose not to have a concentration. Students who choose to pursue a concentration are required to take a minimum of two electives as well as write a thesis in their field of specialization. Should students select a concentration, it is required that they do so by the beginning of the third semester, so that they are able to take a minimum of two electives in their chosen subfields before writing their theses. Additionally, each student must choose their thesis advisor by the beginning of the third semester. This should be the professor with whom the student feels most compatible both intellectually and personally.   Students are required to graduate with a total of 48 credits. These are distributed over four semesters with 12 credits per semester. Each course carries 4 credits, and the final semester thesis will carry 8 credits. MA students cannot register for more than three courses per semester. Students are thus expected to take 10 courses while they complete their thesis. Of these 10 courses, 4 are required courses and the other 6 are electives. 4 Required Courses: Seminar in Literary Theory: This course will focus on the study of various schools of literary theory. The course seeks to examine the bigger questions of literature—ranging from the ways in which texts can engage with various issues to an understanding of how we make meaning—by examining how various theorists address them. Seminar in Writing and Research Methodology: This course aims to provide clues to read, interpret and write academically.  The aim of the course is to expose students to methods of gleaning arguments, writing abstracts; identifying archives; learning citation styles; and familiarising them with a range of research methods. Graduate Pro-Seminar: Thesis Preparation: The graduate pro-seminar is a two-semester sequence. In the first semester, students will have the opportunity to familiarise themselves with the methodological foundations of thesis writing by engaging with research-active faculty and their writing, learning directly from scholars in the field. Graduate Pro-Seminar: Thesis Writing: In the second semester of the graduate pro-seminar, students will workshop their thesis drafts through a series of round tables and conference-style panel presentations, culminating in an academic symposium at which they will present their thesis projects to a larger audience. 8 Electives: Apart from the required courses, students are free to take 8 elective courses that cater to their individual interests. As the programme encourages interdisciplinarity, students are allowed to take one of these 8 electives from another Department across their two years of study. The other 7 electives must be taken from the electives offered by the English and Creative Writing department. At least two of these electives must cover periods before 1800. If students have an area of interest that has not been explored by any of the offered electives, they may also approach faculty to propose the possible creation of an Independent Study Module (ISM) that focuses on the subject in question. The availability of ISMs will depend on the consent of the faculty advisor. Students can take up to a maximum of one ISM on a topic of their devising.

South Asian Literature (SAL) This concentration adopts a comparative approach to the study of textual and popular cultural traditions of South Asia (India, Pakistan, Sri Lanka, Bangladesh, Afghanistan and Nepal). In working towards this concentration, students develop an understanding of South Asia as a ‘region’ by exploring its overlapping and divergent religious and political contexts of the self and the community. Courses might include (but are not limited to): Partition Literature, Scripting Caste, Women Writers from South Asia, Violence and South Asian Literatures, Indian Literatures in Translation, Sufi Poetry, Bollywood and the Ideas of India. Global and Indian Shakespeares (GIS) Shakespeare’s work has been reimagined all over the world in a variety of media.  His plays have been reconceived with extraordinary frequency across the Indian subcontinent, in theatre, literature and especially film, often tackling issues such as gender, colonialism, caste, communal violence, and partition.  Students in this concentration are invited to hone their critical and creative skills by producing their own locally grounded reimaginings. Courses might include (but are not limited to): Masala Shakespeare, Shakespeare and the World, Spectres of Hamlet, Shakesqueer, Adapting Shakespeare: Writing and Performance Workshop. Gender and Sexuality Studies (GSS) This track will focus on the importance of gender and sexuality in literature as well as in our everyday lives. Rather than following the trajectory of  “women” or “homosexuals” as categories, we will put pressure on the assumptions undergirding these categories in the first place. Students will be taught to ground their thinking of literature and the world in wider theoretical frameworks related to queer and feminist thought. Courses might include (but are not limited to): Reading the Body Politic, A History of Desire in India, Shakesqueer, South Asian Literature and Gender, Desiring Film, Women’s Writing, Victorian Fetishes, The Law of Desire, Bollywood and Gender, Dalit Literature. Modern Literature and Culture (MLC) This track of study explores the question of modernity and its aftermath, ranging from the Enlightenment era to the present. Areas of focus include 18th, 19th and 20th century literature and culture, modernisms including vernacular modernisms in literature and cinema, postmodernism, postcolonial literatures, law and literature, ecocriticism and discourse analysis. Courses might include (but are not limited to): Epic Histories, Privacy, Neoliberalism, Trauma and Disaster, Children’s Literature, Cinema and Violence, Acts of Faith, ‘Romanticism, History, Prophecy’, American Outlaws, Conspiracy Fiction, Conquests of Nature, Climate Fiction, Reading Theory, The Law of Desire, Victorian Fetishes, Making Space, Loss and Longing, Literature and the Age of Empire, Postcolonial Literature, The Rhetoric of Social Protest, Critical Race Theory.  Global Medieval Studies (GM) The Global Medieval Studies concentration takes a comparativist approach to the cultures of the various medieval periods in world history, particularly in Europe and South Asia, while encouraging students to think critically about periodic nomenclatures. The track encourages students to think about the medieval not simply as a historical field, but also as a conceptual category that is critical to our constructions of antiquity and modernity. This concentration brings medieval works from different cultures into conversation while also encouraging the interdisciplinary study of literature, art and architecture, music, science, religion and philosophy. Courses might include (but are not limited to): Global Medieval Women Writers, Comparative Medieval Mysticism, Global Medievalisms, Utopia in the Middle Ages, Medieval Travel Writing, History of Medieval Medicine, University Cultures. Creative Writing (CW) The Creative Writing track combines literary study with creative practice. Along with courses in the academic study of literature, students also take workshop courses and write a thesis in the genre of their choice: original prose, poetry, and translation, including multi-genre work. Courses might include (but are not limited to): Poetry Workshop, Fiction Workshop, Translation Workshop, Publishing Seminar.      MA English Handbook      The Master of Arts (MA) programme in English at Ashoka University aims to occupy an important space in the current landscape of higher education in India.

The Office of Student Affairs works toward building opportunities that help students nurture their creative endeavours while striving for excellence. The University recently laid the foundation stone for a new 27-acre campus in Sonipat. Adjacent to the existing campus, the new complex will have 6 academic buildings, 10 residential buildings, utility and services buildings and a sports field. The campus will address Ashoka’s increasing focus on the Sciences and research. The 1.80 million square feet of area in the new campus will be integrated with the current facility and will follow Ashoka University’s existing campus design philosophy and unique brick and Jaali façade.  Acre state-of-the-art campus Fully furnished, air- conditioned rooms Students studying on Financial Aid   The Office of Student Affairs drives student experience outside the classroom. It is aimed towards making the university life of students enriching and well-rounded. Student Affairs cultivates and promotes student learning and development, with a strong commitment towards diversity, inclusion and mutual respect; physical and mental wellbeing; cultural enrichment and creating opportunities for empowerment.         The Student Life Office drives the extra-curricular, student leadership and development programming of the University which range from creative and performative arts, leadership and training opportunities, experiential learning, volunteering opportunities, driving student-led programmes and much more. By championing, guiding and encouraging student organisations, clubs, initiatives and events, the Office promotes maximum student participation and involvement in campus life. Through our various programmes and activities, the Office strives to give our students the best of opportunities.   Student Services:         At Ashoka, when not occupied with academics, students find themselves immersed in pursuing creative hobbies and interests through clubs and societies. These prove to be an ocean of opportunities to contribute to and enrich the campus experience culturally and intellectually. A “club” on the other hand has a very definite field of work it is committed to. A “society” is an umbrella of two or more clubs with diverse pursuits, brought together by a focal interest area.     Residence Life at Ashoka University welcomes students to a community of diverse and talented scholars, residing in a close-knit and dynamic learning environment. The Residence Life Office is dedicated to creating a safe and vibrant residential experience for students on Campus. The fundamental role and responsibility of students in this regard are to familiarise themselves with Ashoka University Residence Life Policies. As members of a residential community, students are expected to uphold a high standard of character and take responsible ownership of their actions within campus premises.       Sports and Exercise will be intrinsically tied to the years students spend at Ashoka University. The process of creating truly global citizens is well underway at the sports fields in the University. This unique process does not only provide state-of-the-art sports facilities but also encourages sports to be taken up by one and all. True transformation can only take place when students are able to push themselves out of their comfort zone. This process demands learning more about themselves before they even attempt to change anything around them.

For civil and congenial participation in the campus residence life experience, students are expected to familiarise themselves and abide by this policy. Any violation of this policy will result in a disciplinary infraction with a consequent course of action as decided by the appropriate University committee.      Room and Roommate Assignment A. Room Allocation At the beginning of the academic year, room allotment is made on a twin-sharing basis for the entire academic year as per the building-level assignments approved by the University. For emergency preparedness, the University needs to know the room assignment of each student living in campus housing. Students therefore may not change rooms or roommates without official authorisation. Note: Students who are not enrolled in any academic courses will not be allotted a room within the University housing. B. Disability related Accommodations Students are expected to self-identify any specific disability-related needs and raise their requests via email with the Office of Learning Support (OLS) at ols@ashoka.edu.in to avail housing accommodations prior to the start of the academic year. Incoming students may reach out to the Office of Admissions first while returning students (who have a newly-diagnosed condition or a change to a previously documented condition) can register directly with OLS. Students are required to provide comprehensive professional documentation of their disability to the Office of Learning Support. OLS will then assess and recommend housing accommodations (such as location, lights, washroom accessibility, ergonomic furniture etc.) to the Residence Life Office. The student must be willing to live in any Residence Hall and/or room that is determined to meet their disability/medical need by the University. All such accommodations will be made on a space-available basis and only for the concerned individual – not for a group. C. Room Reassignment Both occupants may request a room change for non-functioning room facilities or any other difficult room experience related to the infrastructure. In all such situations, the concerned students should meet with their respective Warden for appropriate assistance. Once the Warden confirms the validity of the request made, they may recommend a room change for the occupants in consultation with the senior member(s) of the Residence Life Office. If the room change request is approved, the Residence Life Office will make an offer regarding the feasible arrangement. After the offer is made, the student will have 24 hours to decline or accept the offer. If the offer is accepted, the students will have 48 hours to move into the newly assigned room and return the keys for the previous assignment. If the students do not respond to the offer within the stipulated duration of 24 hours, the offer will be withdrawn by the Residence Life Office. Reassignments for special circumstances, such as a recommendation from the Office of Learning Support (OLS), serious facility-related problems that can be a potential life hazard etc., will be given the highest priority. Important: Residence Life Office reserves the right to reassign any room if deemed necessary during the academic year. D.

During the Exit Clearance process from the University, due to withdrawal from/completion of their academic programme, the students must surrender their ID card back to the Residence Life Office. Residence Support The Residence Life Office is managed through the efforts of a robust team of staff.

Quiet Hours In an effort to encourage a comfortable studying and resting environment for all students, Quiet Hours on the entire campus, including the Residence Halls, are to be observed between 01:00 am to 07:00 am every day. During Quiet Hours, students are expected to refrain from playing music or creating loud noise in the Residence Hall rooms, washrooms, hallways etc. Even at all other 7times, students are expected to not cause 8disturbance to other members of the Ashoka community. Construction, renovation, and repair projects (both on and off campus) will necessarily cause increased noise around directly involved and nearby Residence Halls. While all possible measures are taken to minimise the impact of these projects, any student moving into or living in affected areas should be prepared to accept the unavoidable aspects of life on campus under construction and post-construction. Students moving out of the University campus to adjoining village areas and institutions must ensure that they do not create any disturbance that will inconvenience the residents of the neighbourhood. Policies and Regulations Residence Life is governed by various rules and regulations to ensure seamless functioning and harmonious and healthy living conditions for one and all. Listed below is a brief outline of these rules and regulations: Ashoka University Campus – including the Residence Halls – is an alcohol-free, smoke-free and drug-free campus, governed by national, state and university laws and regulations for the same. The University does not permit both check-in and check-out from the campus between the hours of 12:00 AM (midnight) to 6:00 AM. This means that no student is allowed to enter/exit campus after 12:00 AM (midnight) and no student is allowed to enter/exit campus before 6:00 AM. Off-campus visitors will not have access to the Residence Halls. They are allowed to visit students on campus between 8:00 am and 108:00 pm. Parents/Guardians will be permitted to access their ward’s room during moving-in at the time of Orientation and moving out at the end of the academic programme (and on occasions of medical emergencies, with prior knowledge and approval of the respective Warden.) Off-campus students are expected to carry their University ID Card with them and sign in at the front desk to gain admittance inside the Residence Halls. They will not have access to the resident rooms but may meet with their peers in the Common Room of the Residence Hall. The movement of students visiting Residence Hall rooms is allowed both ways across men’s and women’s Residence Halls between 8:00 am and 12:30 am. The students must sign in and sign out manually through registers maintained at the entrance of all Residences Halls. However, the rights of the roommate supersede the privilege of visitation i.e. visitation is a privilege that is subordinate to the resident’s rights such as the right to privacy and the right to free and uninhibited access to the room. Therefore, a resident’s request for any guest to leave their room must be honoured, irrespective of the visitation hours and regardless of the sex or gender of the guest. Misuse, duplication, and/or lending of your keys and ID Card is prohibited. Students will be personally responsible for the maintenance of their rooms, furniture, bathrooms and University property in their use.

Note: Kindly refer to the Residence Life Policies available on the portal for more details.      The Residence Life Programme at Ashoka University comprises of a wide variety of vibrant social, educational, recreational and cultural programmes that are run and led by the Residence Life Staff and students. These Residence Life Programmes are centered around the core values and principles of civic responsibility, citizenship, empathy, respect, diversity, inclusion, self-care, health, and wellness. The focus of these programmes is to help foster a sense of community among residents giving them ample opportunities to meet, interact, bond and have fun together.   Resident Assistants (RAs) are paraprofessionals who live on a floor with 40-70 residents, managing critical administrative tasks as well as the primary responsibility of responding to the personal needs of these residents. Their unique positions, as quasi-staff members within the Residence Halls, allow them to act as a force for positive change in the lives of the students with whom they interact. The RA Programme aims to create an inclusive living environment in the Halls of Residence and works towards fostering an environment that embraces diversity and actively values the dignity and self-worth of all members of the community. This is done by the RAs through various active community programming efforts on the floor and across the Residence Halls, regular one-on-one office hours, periodic floor meetings etc. The RAs also plan and host a plethora of social and educational activities for residents thus, enabling a positive living environment in the Residence Halls. These range from events addressing issues of gender & sexuality and self-care to floor cook-offs and game nights to name a few. The Resident Assistant Coordinators (RACs) along with the RA Mentors supervise and manage the RA Programme. The RACs work in tandem with the Dean (Office of Student Affairs) and the Associate Director (Residence Life Office) to develop the RA Programme as a whole. The RACs also serve as mentors to students, and are available during selected business hours to discuss concerns related to Residence as well as Campus Life. Follow us on Instagram :      Dorm Olympics is one of the biggest and most sought-after events organised in the Residence Halls.

By inviting faculty, staff and experts, the series aims to demystify and destigmatize these subjects, allowing for open, free-flowing conversations. Their aim is twofold- one of creating opportunities for an empathetic listening and awareness; other enabling students in dealing with real life challenges and situations towards making an informed choice.      The Great Ashokan Weekend was initiated with the purpose of facilitating student interaction with staff and faculty in a fun and informal setting. Each event of the great Ashokan Weekend is designed as a walk-through of the campus moving between key landmarks on the premises. Despite being held online, the event saw active participation from faculty, staff and students in 2020.

Through our various programmes and activities, the Office strives to give our students the best of opportunities. The various programmes and initiatives of the Office aim to help students appreciate the intricate connection between human life and its socio-cultural fabric, thus enriching student relationships between each other and the world around them.        At Ashoka University, when not occupied with academics, students will find themselves immersed in pursuing their hobbies and interests through clubs and societies! These will give students an ocean of opportunities to contribute and enrich their campus experience culturally and intellectually. Ranging from music, dance and gaming to community engagement, language, creative writing, photography, culinary and much more, students may choose from amongst the array of 39 existing clubs and societies functioning on campus, and also initiate their own! A ‘Club’ is a focused group working towards a specific field of interest. A ‘Society’ is an umbrella organisation which has under it two or more clubs. These clubs have diverse interests and pursuits with a common objective and focal interest area that affiliates them to a single domain and binds them together. The Student Life Office wants our clubs and societies to be able to hone their passions and also excel in them. We are committed to providing full support and encouragement to them through mentorship, training, infrastructure and financial support.     Annual Traditions The Clubs get ample opportunity to showcase their talents through annual traditions created by the Office such as Jashn-e-Jazba (a platform for clubs to provide a sneak-peak into what they do); Annual Production Fortnight (a year-end mega-event) where clubs bring to the fore their creative work that the year’s hard work and passion have culminated with; Clubs and Societies Fair, interuniversity events and other regular activities.         Training and support that is ongoing through the year, the leadership and members of approved clubs and societies interact and meet with the mentors from the Office on a regular basis. The meetings are used to pilot planning of club/society activities, brainstorming and troubleshooting, thus creating an active and vibrant culture on Campus.      The Student Life Office also brings to students a host of physical spaces for a variety of creative pursuits. While a fully equipped and functional Music Studio will help students record and produce their own music, the Art Room will allow students to chase their artistic pursuits. The Music Room hones a host of musicians, vocal and instrumental alike. The Student Commons is a space that has been thoughtfully curated for the purpose of study, discussion, public speaking, student meetings and debates. It is an expanse that has been creatively thought out in terms of placement, design and interiors, to allow for the various intellectually and creatively stimulating activities that students can pursue in their learning, outside the classroom.   Baithaks This programme has been conceptualised and envisioned to create a non-stage forum, centred on performing arts and conversations that intend to engage, listen and speak with the audience. With this format, Baithak aims to bridge the insurmountable divide between the audience and the performer. The Baithaks range from beginning a dialogue on relevant issues around us, to simply soaking in the creative churning of an art form such as poetry, dance, theatre, storytelling etc. The programme was launched in the year 2018 and has organised multiple Baithaks since then including but not limited to Kathak Mehfil by Ishwari Despande, ‘Love Expressed….’ by Dilip Shankar and Mandakini Goswami, ‘Sattriya Bela’ by the Majuli Monks of Assam, ‘Ek Baar Ki Baat Hai’ by ‘Jashn – e – Qalam’, Vilasini Natyam by Purvadhanashree and Leather puppetry by B. Muthuchandran.   Safarnama ‘Safarnama’ is an initiative that aims to provide an opportunity to Ashokans to explore Delhi, Haryana as well as other cities: their art, music, theatre, cuisines, monuments and much more! All of us have our own unique experiences of each city and it means different things to different people. Safarnama seeks to give every explorer their own special reasons to explore these cities. As a city with diverse pasts, Delhi has not only seen the rise and fall of great empires but has also been at the heart of the nation-building process in independent India. This city with its distinct historical past and rich cultural heritage is an interesting amalgamation of modernity and tradition, past and present, old and new, local and global. Safarnama aims to capture this unique juxtaposition of Delhi, through the various tours that will be conducted under its ambit. Each tour aims to explore Delhi through a distinct lens; its historical monuments, its rich heritage, its flora and fauna, its mouth-watering cuisines, its bustling markets and the way in which Delhi is lived by its inhabitants, every single day. Some of the tours that have been conducted so far from campus include ‘Trees of Delhi’ by environmentalist Pradip Krishen, Food Walk in Chandni Chowk with Sohail Hashmi, ‘Birds of Delhi’ in Okhla Bird Sanctuary & Sultanpur National Park, Museums of Delhi, Exploring ‘Mini-Bengal’ of Delhi, ‘Quila-e-Kuhna’ mosque at Purana Quila, ‘Surajkund Mela’, ‘Dilli Haat’, a walk at Mehrauli Archaeological Park and a ‘Walk with Djinns of Delhi’ in the ruins of Ferozeshah Kotla Fort. Special outstation trips to Mahmudabad Fort to experience decadent cuisines and ceremonies have also been organised.   Haats Ashoka University, located in Sonepat Haryana organises a cultural expansion event in the form of a ‘Haat’, to acquaint our multicultural students hailing from diverse backgrounds, with experiences and realities of local Haryanvi cultural heritage. Educative, informative and interactive; these ‘Haats’ aim to indulge students and staff in a cultural and social evolvement blending them with the Haryanvi heritage by showcasing artisans, food stalls, craftsmanship etc. From the durry workers of Panipat to artisans of the Khadi Ashram, the famous Pyaarelal Pedawala to the signature jalebis of Maturam Halwai, from our potters of Asawarpur to beautiful bangles from the chudiwali, it is a platform for students to witness, the indigenous spirit of Haryana. The ‘Haat’ encourages hands-on interaction between the local artisans and the students, to build a mutual relationship and appreciate the Haryanvi heritage and also participate in making the artefacts by themselves.     Lecture-Demonstrations & Guest Sessions At Ashoka University, “Education” is not confined to degrees and grades! Learning – that is marked by quality and depth of knowledge – is part of the accomplishment, which adds excellence to the education here. Awareness of and engagement with different kinds of art and cultural activities gives one a complete picture of the world around, and more importantly, a complete understanding of one’s own self. Some of the stalwarts of their fields and disciplines whom the community have witnessed on Campus so far, include – Pandit Vishwa Mohan Bhatt, environmentalist Pradip Krishen’s “Wild Tours” with students, exploration of issues around gender through movement art with danseuse Mirra Arun, Dhrupad by maestro Padma Shri Ustad Wasifuddin Dagar, Thumris by Padma Shri Shubha Mudgal, Kathak recital by Padma Shri Shovana Narayan, pottery workshop by an indigenous artisan from the neighbouring village, music concert by Rabbi Shergil, Solo Theatre performance by Anant Dayal, “Partition Project” by Sonam Kalra, Sufi music by the Niyazi Brothers, “Women on Record” by Vidya Shah, folk traditions by the Manganiyars from Rajasthan, Bhapang by Jumma Yogi Khan, Pandvani by Padma Vibhushan Teejan Bai, Raagini: Haryanvi Kissagoi, Dastan-e-Goi, dance maestros Leela Samson and Justin McCarthy (also a faculty member)– and many more!

Not only this, but the Office also programs various creative workshops such as recycling, survival cooking, photography, pottery, gardening etc. Through such a vibrant and syncretic programme palette, the Office aspires to bring a synergy of cultures, traditions, experiences and opportunities to the student’s doorstep; thus, making these precious years of their University life memorable with moments of awakening new sensibilities and taste.      As students at Ashoka University, individuals will be encouraged to initiate their own projects and/or participate in the wide range of extra-curricular activities buzzing on campus. Be it running a club, working as an elected member of the Student Government, taking along a diverse team, in short, simply being a dynamic student in all spheres of their “student life” at Ashoka University – the Office will help them to effectively carry out the various responsibilities and projects that they undertake. With a variety of sessions conducted throughout the year, here is a glimpse into what these largely entail.           Volunteer The Student Life Office has a few other channels too for student contribution and participation. The Office recruits volunteers throughout the year for the entire gamut of the programmes that it does. It is for students to choose their area of interest and they will be on board for this creative journey! Paid internship opportunities are floated to students, who wish to work on certain projects of the Office. These are opportunities for students to create traditions and concepts based on novel ideas that they might bring to the table. The Office has also recruited student entrepreneurs and programmers, to create certain tools towards technical sophistication in functioning. These are some, but not all the opportunities that students might find throughout their “student life” at Ashoka University.   Office Hours Members of the Student Life Office are available to meet and interact with our students. Be it a conversation or thought students wish to share, an initiative students wish to propose, a problem students wish to seek assistance for or anything else that students wish to have a patient hearing for… the office members are all ears! The Office has a systematic procedure for booking appointments with anyone that students wish to meet. The Office looks forward to having students visit them over the course of their academic years at Ashoka University.   TownHalls The Student Life Office convenes townhalls every quarter of the academic year for regular and effective communication with all clubs and societies. These townhalls are open to all bonafide students of Ashoka University.

CWC is the largest centre in Ashoka and works with all the diverse sections that make the Ashoka community: the entire student body (from the undergraduate students to research scholars), faculty, staff and other specialised centres in the university. This is made possible by the diversity of the CWC team which is a vibrant group of scholars, professionals, writers and researchers whose combined expertise actively contributes to the interdisciplinary engagement at Ashoka.         CWC’s interactions with the students are both in-class, through lectures, creative workshops, and one-on-one sessions. Through the year, the CWC provides writing and pedagogical support to courses across disciplines at Ashoka.         Besides course-specific activities, the CWC organizes a broad range of creative and research activities that address a variety of skills under the umbrella of writing and communication. These events innovatively draw upon and analyse a diverse range of activities and media which are part of our daily lives: news, email, music, internet, media, board games, photographs, food, and jokes, to name a few. These are open to the public and follow a participatory format.       Center for Writing and Communications organizes an annual conference (bringing together educators, scholars, students, and activists working in the field of education), Research Forum (a platform for the academic staff of the university to share their research), and Summer School (offering writing courses on research, academic and creative writing).       CWC has maintained its media presence over the years on multiple social media platforms and through several initiatives, keeping student-specific needs in mind. Our social media handles have seen a consistent increase in engagement from our followers. Some of our most popular activities have been: book and film Recommendations on Instagram, our podcast series #BackToTheTutor, the YouTube series Shelf Pick where people from both academic and non-academic backgrounds take you through their all time favorite reads, and ‘Decoding College Applications’, in which graduate students advise prospective applicants and answer the most daunting questions about framing college applications.

Our programme, developed bottom-up for the Indian context, is designed to cultivate rigorous writing practices in first-year students. It is our understanding that an education in the liberal arts is built upon the foundation of analytical thinking communicated through clear and persuasive writing across disciplines. To foster these critical competencies, our instructors give individual attention to each student’s communication skills, both written and oral, at the level of structure, sentence, and vocabulary. Our flagship course, Introduction to Critical Thinking, is taught through small, seminar-style classes, which employ the best writing pedagogy practices from across the world to nurture writing and critical thinking in the first year of undergraduate training.

One-on-One Sessions Students can avail one-on-one appointments with CWC tutors. The CWC recognizes  individualized feedback to students as a crucial component through all stages of their academic writing—from brainstorming ideas, to logically developing arguments and finally revising their work. These sessions are open to students across disciplines and levels of study.   English Language Teaching Throughout the academic year, CWC provides English language support to students relatively unfamiliar with the language, helping them towards fluency and better understanding. Starting with the Academic Bridge Programme conducted for incoming students in the summer, the support continues in the form of English Communication and Intermediate English Communication courses in the Monsoon and the Spring semesters respectively. In addition to offering these credited courses, the CWC also provides course-specific support to students by familiarizing them with discipline-specific vocabulary, comprehension of texts, participation in classroom discussions, making presentations, and editing drafts. This is done over regular one-on-one appointments in consultation with the course instructor.   Plagiarism & Citation Workshops Each year, the CWC conducts several Plagiarism and Citation workshops that focus on academic ethics, conventions, and styles. This year, the workshops engaged closely with the university’s Academic Integrity Policy and elaborated upon the significance of abiding by the same. Through interactive activities and illustrative examples, the workshops introduced the UG’25 batch to plagiarism, referencing, summarization, and citation styles. Course Specific Workshops The course-specific workshops designed and conducted by CWC address the most fundamental aspects of academic writing and critical thinking.  It includes both mandatory workshops such as the one on plagiarism, citation, and academic integrity for the first year undergraduate students and others that are optional or conducted on request. Some of the workshops conducted for various  courses like Economics, Film Studies, History, English, Environment Studies include: How to write using multiple sources?; How to read fiction critically?; Writing around numbers; Planning a historiographical essay; What is an argument?; How to write strong conclusions?; How to write an introduction?; Plagiarism and Citation; Writing Captions.   How to book an appointment with a CWC tutor:              Programme Interested InUndergraduate ProgrammeYoung India FellowshipYSPPhDMA - EconomicsMA EnglishMSC Biology Year of Admission2022-232023-242024-252025-26  Subscribe to our communications [current_url]     Plot No. 2, Rajiv Gandhi Education City, National Capital Region P.O.

We emphasise the critical empiricism, theoretical engagement and comparative approach central to our best disciplinary traditions. Our department encourages interdisciplinary explorations with allied fields of social thought and inquiry, including history, economics, political science, geography, psychology, philosophy, linguistics, environmental studies, computer science, planning and design, natural sciences, arts and aesthetics, law and media. Some of the areas and themes the faculty work on are contested borderlands, agricultural markets and exchange, mental health clinics, regional cinema audiences, political economy of water, food, hazards and disasters, rivers and islands, infrastructure and informality, anthropology of literature, philosophical anthropology, cities and environment, and the state, bureaucracy, law and violence.Our department acknowledges the similarities between the disciplines of Sociology and Anthropology. Going beyond stereotypes of the sociologist conducting surveys in a city and the anthropologist doing fieldwork in a remote village, we recognize that both Sociology and Anthropology study relations between the personal and thepolitical, the micro and the macro, and the individual and the institutional. Sociology and Anthropology teach us to challenge and refine our taken-for-granted cultural assumptions by attempting to understand those of others.We offer both undergraduate and graduate programmes of study. Our undergraduate programme consists of a major, minor and concentration in Sociology and Anthropology.

This mentor is available by appointment to discuss all academic issues including course selection, academic planning and liaising with another faculty. In semester 3, once the student has declared her major, the mentor is replaced by a Major Advisor- a faculty member from the chosen major discipline, who takes over the duties of the Faculty Mentor. Do encourage your student to meet with her mentor/ advisor regularly.   In the first semester, students fill in a Foundation Course Preference Form. 3 or 4 Foundation Courses are assigned to the student on the basis of this form through an algorithm. One section of Introduction to Critical Thinking, a mandatory course, may also be assigned through the same algorithm.  All students are also encouraged to attend the Orientation Sessions held by academic departments to get a sense of the kind of study involved in each discipline. At the end of semester 1, students must meet with their Faculty Mentor prior to registering for the next semester’s classes. Faculty Mentors and later Academic Advisors discuss requirements and help students develop a plan for the upcoming semesters.   Students view their grades through the Learning Management System. Parents and families can’t access student grades directly. We encourage you to maintain open lines of communication with your students so that they feel confident enough to share their grades with you. If a student is placed on academic review due to consistently poor performance, a letter is sent to the student and the parent.   First talk with your student about what resources are available on campus. They can (and should) talk with their faculty advisor and current faculty about getting help with assignments or they may visit the Center for Writing and Communication ( CWC), the tutoring and academic assistance center. If your student is unable to access these resources or if it seems too late for this to be helpful, have your student meet with an officer from the Office of Academic Affairs. The student can also, either on the advice of the mentor/ advisor or independently, seek extra help from the Office of Learning Support. Such support may also be provided on the recommendation of any of the student’s course instructors.   Economics, Psychology, Political Science and Computer Science have had the highest number of majors in recent years, but since all our Major Departments have excellent faculty, your student will be well-served in any of the programmes on offer.   The Ashoka Scholars Programme is a year- long postgraduate diploma that offers undergraduate students an exciting opportunity to broaden their academic horizons or acquire a deeper skill set in their chosen field of study. The programme gives students a distinct advantage over other undergraduate students in the job market, as well as for postgraduate study. In addition, students who want to pursue a Masters or a PhD degree abroad need an equivalent of a four-year undergraduate degree – e.g. in the US, but also elsewhere. The ASP year works very well to meet that requirement. More details of the ASP programme can be found here.   The break between Spring and Monsoon semester is called the Summer Semester. Students are encouraged to use this time for internships, independent study projects or to participate in Study Abroad opportunities. The University also offers an intensive six-week study programme, during the summer for undergraduate students. A range of four-credit courses is offered across disciplines. Enrolling for the summer term provides an opportunity for Ashoka students to take courses that helps to gain additional credits, accelerate in their academic pathway or simply explore other areas of interest. Specific programs change each year and students learn of them through departmental emails and postings around campus.   The Office of International Programmes provides Ashoka students with a range of resources and services as they explore international study abroad options, whether it is for the summer or a semester. The best advice we can offer for parent involvement is for you to learn as much as you can about the country where your student will be studying so you can ask good questions (and communicate often) while they are abroad. For more information, please visit Study Abroad webpage.     We currently have five Residence Halls on campus, which are located adjacent to each other and close to the Dining Hall making it convenient to visit friends and go for meals. The halls have between 7-10 floors with about 20-35 rooms on each floor. Each floor has its own set of bathrooms with showers, toilets and sinks. The rooms are allotted on a twin sharing basis and are furnished with two beds and mattresses, book racks, wardrobes, study desks and chairs. Each room also has windows to allow for adequate natural light. The Common Rooms on the ground floor of each Hall come equipped with upholstered chairs, couches and tables to accommodate work and social interactions.   The University is required to assign student housing based on the gender designation in their official University record (through the Office of the Registrar). Incoming students are assigned roommates with the help of relevant information provided by them through the ‘Roommate Matching’ form. Returning students are allowed to choose their preferred roommate through the ‘Roommate Preference’ form. All batches of students are allotted roommates from within their own batch.   No student is allowed to change their allotted room or roommate without official authorization. However, students may request a room change for reasons such as non- functioning of room facilities or any other difficult room experience such as roommate conflicts. We strongly encourage roommates to first communicate with one another carefully and responsibly in an attempt to improve their living situation. If that does not lead to positive outcomes, the student can approach their Resident Assistant (RA) about the conflict; the RA will initiate a mediation process to address the conflict in the best possible manner. After the mediation, further options may also be explored to ensure a healthy living environment for the student.   Students can meet off-campus visitors in the Residence Halls’ common room only between 8:00 am and 8:00 pm. Visitors do not have access to the student rooms and won’t be allowed on campus premises outside the stipulated hours. Students are allowed to visit each other’s rooms in different Residence Halls irrespective of their gender at all times between 08:00 am to 12:30 am.   Yes. Students can use the pantry area on each floor, which is equipped with an induction plate, microwave oven, refrigerator and has common storage cupboards and dishwashing area. However, students are not allowed to use any personal appliances (coffee makers, mini-fridge, induction/hot plates, etc.) inside the Residence Halls.   In an effort to encourage a comfortable studying and resting environment for all students, Quiet Hours on campus, including the Residence Halls, are to be observed between 01:00 am to 07:00 am every day. During Quiet Hours, students are expected to refrain from playing music or creating loud noise in the Residence Hall rooms, washrooms, hallways etc.   Ashoka offers a web of extracurricular activities, striking a fine balance between activities that are fun and those that are intellectually challenging. Students are encouraged to pursue their hobbies and interests through an array of existing Clubs and Societies  and also have the opportunity to initiate new clubs or societies, subject to relevant policies. Information about events and activities conducted by these student groups is shared regularly with the entire Ashoka community through email, social media, and campus postings. There is also a range of active and invigorating Sports Programmes across a dozen disciplines, complete with world-class facilities.     Subscription to dining services as per the minimum cover charge is mandatory for all the students. Meals over the value of the cover charge are charged at cost per meal. Various eateries on campus offer further variety in food, some of which remain open through the night with delivery options for students’ convenience. The general provisions shop on campus stocks some fresh fruit in addition to packaged items.   Dining Services is able to accommodate some dietary needs/restrictions and under special medical circumstances can work with students to meet their requirements, including developing a plan that may include special menu items, ingredient identification, special preparation, and communication to necessary staff to ensure that your student can eat safely. Please contact the    The University provides primary health care services, including minor emergency treatment such as burns, minor lacerations, sprains, or strains to all students. A doctor and paramedical staff are available on campus 24*7. Medicines and tests prescribed by the resident doctor are available on chargeable basis.   In case of severe illnesses the parents or the family are informed immediately. The student (if medically alert and conscious), will also be kept in loop while notifying the parent(s) or guardian. For emergencies, the University has an arrangement with Max Hospital, Shalimar Bagh. A medical ambulance is available on campus 24*7. All students of the University are covered under an insurance of INR 1 Lac applicable upon hospitalization of 24 hours or more.   Encourage your student to seek help anytime she is feeling anxious, having sudden mood changes, or there is some sort of distress, feelings of helplessness or confusion, academic pressures, relationship troubles or adjustment issues. She could: speak with her student residential assistant (RA). Residential life staff are trained to assist students with accessing campus resources; make an appointment at Ashoka Center for Well Being (ACWB). The counseling center offers 24-hour mental health services and a myriad of other counseling services. The counseling center is open to all Ashoka students free of charge.    Obtaining counseling services is an individual decision. If you feel like your student may benefit from counseling, talk to them. Explain your thoughts and feelings. Remember, they are adults now, beginning to make their own decisions and only they can decide if counseling is a service they wish to obtain. Ultimately, the choice is theirs. Understanding Transition is a session for students and parents held by the Ashoka Center for Well Being( ACWB) each year during Orientation Week. We strongly encourage you to attend it.     Ashoka University is now a preferred destination for several leading recruiters across the corporate and social sector.  The CDO assists students in aligning their aptitude with their interests and skills, and guides them to pursue fulfilling opportunities. CDO offers unlimited one-to-one counselling, resume workshops, mock interviews, and skill-building workshops, and hosts a multitude of eminent professionals from diverse industries to share their experiences .  Read more about career development opportunities here   The Office of Global Education and Strategic Programmes provides regular support to students exploring higher education opportunities by organizing Graduate Information Sessions and Town Halls. In addition, the office staff meet students frequently to provide assistance relevant to the students’ interests and academic journeys, including with programme applications, visa applications and scholarship opportunities. Information on interesting research internships and other unique opportunities is communicated through emails and campus postings.     International students face changes in nearly every aspect of their life when they leave home to study abroad. Changes in diet, sleeping patterns and climate may affect their health and well-being. Students should provide a copy of their medical records, including immunizations and vaccinations, to the health center when they arrive on campus. These records should show all medicines or treatments the student is using. This will help doctors, and other health care professionals provide safe care if the student has a new health problem. Under normal circumstances, students are expected to keep family members informed of their illnesses. However, the Office of Student Life will notify the family in the event of serious illness or accident that requires extensive treatment or hospitalization. All students of the University are covered under an insurance of INR 1 Lac applicable upon hospitalization of 24 hours or more.   Mobile SIM cards may be obtained at the SIM Card kiosk on campus, after completing all necessary documentation. Detailed information and support is provided to students during days of the onboarding of the new cohort in the new academic year. SIM cards are available in prepaid and post-paid segments. CUG and circle portability facility can be availed by the users.   Each international student is paired up with a ‘buddy’, a senior student who will help the new student negotiate the campus as well as residential and academic life. All staff on campus, including support staff understand some English.    For all international students, the Office of Student Affairs in conjunction with the Finance Department will provide assistance in opening a local bank account.

Around ten such scholarships, covering the tuition and residence fee, will be awarded to exceptional candidates admitted to the YIF Class of 2024. Recipients would have typically excelled in more than one area of engagement while also demonstrating leadership. A few admitted candidates in each round will receive an invitation from the YIF Admissions Committee to appear for the Chancellor’s Merit Scholarship interview. Invitations will consider academic, non-academic and/or professional excellence, combined with performance in the holistic selection process. Please note that there is no separate application process for the Chancellor’s Merit Scholarship.   FAQs When can I apply for the Chancellor’s Merit Scholarship? Candidates do not need to make a separate application. All candidates receiving offers for the YIF Class of 2024 will automatically be considered for the Chancellor’s Merit Scholarship shortlist.  What is the basis of selection for the Chancellor’s Merit Scholarship? Candidates will be shortlisted based on their academic, non-academic and/or professional achievements, demonstrated leadership and performance through the holistic selection process. Successful candidates will receive a 100% waiver on the tuition and residence fee, implying that they will only have to pay for the meal plan (unless they also receive need-based financial aid that covers their meals).  When and where will Chancellor’s Merit Scholarship interviews take place? When will candidates know the decision? Some candidates who receive an offer of admission and financial aid, will also receive an invitation for the Chancellor’s Merit Scholarship interview, which will be scheduled for roughly a week after a candidate receives their offer. The interview may take place virtually or in-person. Candidates will know whether or not they have received the Chancellor’s Merit Scholarship before their offer acceptance deadline. Please visit the timelines page to learn more about the dates. Should I apply for the Need-Based Financial Aid if I am interested in becoming a Chancellor’s Merit Scholar? The need-based Financial Aid programme aims to provide necessary financial support to help you bridge the gap between the programme’s cost and your ability to pay. Only a few offer holders will be invited to the Chancellor’s Merit Scholarship interview, so all applicants shortlisted for the Personal Interview are encouraged to apply for Need-Based Financial Aid. Please read the section below about our need-based Financial Aid Programme to learn more about the application process and the necessary documentation.  Can I receive both Need-based Financial Aid and the Chancellor’s Merit Scholarship? Yes, however you would forego whichever scholarship covers lesser of the fee. Offers of Admission and Financial Aid (if granted for those who apply), are sent together. After receiving the offer, a candidate who has received financial aid, may also receive a shortlist notification for the Chancellor’s Merit Scholarship interview. If successful, the candidate would forego the Financial Aid grant, to accept the Chancellor’s Merit Scholarship. The only exception to this would be in case of a circumstance where you are awarded a 100% waiver on Tuition, Residence and Meals via the need-based Financial Aid programme. In this circumstance, you would be a Chancellor’s Merit Scholar, with a need-based waiver on Meals.    Ashoka University’s need-based Financial Aid programme aims to provide necessary financial support which can help you bridge the gap between the cost of the programme and your ability to pay. Several benefactors, including YIF alumni, have made financial aid possible. Before awarding need-based financial aid to Fellows, we expect that the Fellow and/or their family/guardian(s) will consider various resources available to them towards financing the cost of the YIF programme. To complement the need-based aid offered to selected candidates, Ashoka University has collaborated with institutions who enable education loans to help cover any gap between the aid offered and the programme fee.      Candidates may apply for Financial Aid if their YIF Application is shortlisted for the interview stage.      The following are important points to keep in mind regarding the process: The Financial Aid form will open once in each round for approximately one week, and each candidate will have one opportunity to submit an application. Requests made at any other time, especially after receiving an offer of admission, will not be entertained. Candidates will have a few days between knowing their shortlist status and the opening of the Financial Aid form, so that they may start preparing documentation accordingly. We strongly recommend not waiting until the form opening, rather procuring required documents in advance. It is estimated that it will take a candidate a few hours to complete the Financial Aid form, if the required documents and financial information are in order. Please note that in addition to the documentation listed below, we may ask for additional documents during assessment if required (for example, pre-COVID salary slips, in case of reduced pay, GST receipts, etc.) Documents need to be converted into PDF/JPG files of sizes under 2MB, with a minimum resolution of 200 DPI, which is readable. Zip folders under 2MB containing all the documents are also accepted. For all queries and clarifications, please write to BEFORE the submission deadline.   Mandatory Documents and Information Required for all earning members, including the candidate (if applicable). Documentation Income Tax Returns for FY 2019-20, 2020-21 and 2021-22 (last 3 years) Bank Account Statements (for the last 12 months) Salary Statements (for the last 3 months) Loan Statements (if a loan expense is shown)  Information Details of the family’s financial assets, such as investments, real estate, vehicles, etc. Details of any loans, mortgage, etc.    Additional Documents and Information (as applicable) Required in addition to the mandatory documents listed above.  For Business Families and Professionals Financial Statements for FY 2019-20, 2020-21 and 2021-22 (last 3 years) P&L Statement Balance Sheet Form 26AS Details of main expenses (only information is required)  For Haryana Residents The Candidate’s Haryana Domicile Certificate Haryana domicile students are eligible for a full or partial fee concession as per the Haryana Private Universities Act (2006). However, this is subject to the submission of their Government issued Haryana Resident Certificate (Domicile). Please note that Ashoka University reserves the right to determine the percentage of fee concession.     Step 1: Becoming familiar with the Financial Aid Application Please read through this page comprehensively to understand the philosophy, documentation and information required for submitting a Financial Aid application.    Step 2: Applying for need-based Financial Aid Soon after being shortlisted, candidates will receive a notification that the Financial Aid form has been enabled. The form will be enabled in early January 2023 (for Round 1 applicants) and early April 2023 (for Round 2 applicants).  Follow the instructions and start the financial aid application immediately. Candidates will have 7 days from the ​email notification date to complete and submit the form. Prepare for slow internet or other connectivity issues and do not wait until the last minute. The deadline is binding and will not be extended. Forms not submitted will not be considered for Financial Aid.   Step 3: Assessment of Aid Applications The Office of Financial Aid will verify and assess each candidate’s application and information provided in the online form. Please note that parents/guardians/candidates may ​also ​be contacted during this verification process. The Financial Aid Committee will deliberate over the information and make a final decision. Please note that the Committee will not follow up for missing documents. Candidates are expected to provide detailed comments and documents supporting their request for aid.   Step 4: Offer of Admission and Financial Aid Candidates selected by the Admissions Committee will be sent an Offer of Admission and Financial Aid, which would include the Financial Aid package (for those who apply) as decided by the Financial Aid Committee.  If a candidate has been granted aid, it will be reflected in their fee structure and payment plan. Candidates will then be required to follow the instructions on the Admitted Candidate Portal to accept the offer of admission and financial aid by paying the acceptance fee (if applicable) by the acceptance deadline (typically about two weeks from the date of offer).  In the rare case of a concern with respect to the Financial Aid decision (primarily owing to any changes in the financial standing of a candidate between the time they applied for aid and when they receive an offer), candidates will be allowed an opportunity to present their case to the Financial Aid Office.     Ashoka University has collaborated with the following banks and organisations to provide admitted students with the option to explore education loans independent of our financial aid programme.

At the end of the programme, students are expected to have state-of-the-art quantitative skills valued both in academia and in the corporate world.

She said, “We are happy that the multidisciplinary approach we have been practicing is recognised as the right way to prepare students for challenges in their careers. We are also happy that continuous assessment will be the way to evaluate students, which is something we believe in. The Government-recognised multiple entry and exit options at the Undergraduate level will give more options to the youth. This, supported by an Academic Bank of Credit to digitally store academic credits, will go a long way in providing a favourable environment to students to plan their education. Ashoka has a unique one-year multidisciplinary Young India Fellowship programme that is crafted to offer students a rich postgraduate experience in one year. The NEP also has made a bold move to resolve the binary of research and teaching and the focus on research will foster a strong culture for innovation. This, along with enhancement of digital infrastructure, will match our education system with the requirements of today’s dynamic business and economic environment.”   School education  From 10+2 to 5+3+3+4 structure – The current structure of 10+2 education will be modified with a new pedagogical and curricular restructure to 5+3+3+4 covering ages 3-18 pointing towards a more holistic development of learners. Reduce curriculum content – Curriculum content will be reduced in each subject to its core essentials, to make space for critical thinking and more holistic, inquiry-based, discovery-based, discussion-based, and analysis-based learning. Multi-stream educational approach – Learners will have flexibility in choosing subjects across all streams they’d want to pursue. All subjects will be offered at two level of proficiency. Board exams – Board exams to test only competencies and could be modular (depending) and will be offered twice a year. Multilingualism and the power of language – The policy advocates for mother tongue/local language/regional language as the medium of instruction at least till Grade 5, but preferably till Grade 8 and beyond. No language will be imposed on any student. Assessment Reforms – The approach will be towards a more competency-based regular assessment which tests analysis, critical thinking and conceptual clarity. A new National Assessment Centre, PARAKH (Performance Assessment, Review, and Analysis of Knowledge for Holistic Development), will be set up as a standard-setting body. Equitable and Inclusive Education – Learning for All – The policy proposes for a ‘Gender-Inclusion Fund’ and setting up ‘Special Education Zones’ for disadvantaged regions and groups. The NCERT and NCTE will develop guidelines for the education of gifted children. Higher education  Increase GER to 50% by 2035 – The policy aims to increase Gross Enrolment Ration (GER) in higher education including vocational education from 26.3% (2018) to 50% by 2035. Institutions will have the option to run Open Distance Learning (ODL) and online programmes, provided they are accredited to do so, in order to enhance their offerings, improve access, increase GER, and provide opportunities for lifelong learning Holistic and Multidisciplinary Education – The policy introduces broad-based, multi-disciplinary, holistic undergraduate education with flexible curricula, creative combinations of subjects, integration of vocational education and multiple entry and exit points with appropriate certification. The structure and lengths of degree programmes shall be adjusted accordingly. The undergraduate degree will be of either 3 or 4-year duration, with multiple exit options within this period, with appropriate certifications, e.g., a certificate after completing 1 year in a discipline or field including vocational and professional areas, or a diploma after 2 years of study, or a Bachelor’s degree after a 3-year programme. An Academic Bank of Credit (ABC) is set to be established which would digitally store the academic credits earned from various recognised Higher Education Institutes (HEIs) so that the degrees from an HEI can be awarded taking into account credits earned. SAT-like college test – The National Testing Agency (NTA) will conduct common college entrance exam twice a year. Model public universities for holistic and multidisciplinary education called Multidisciplinary Education and Research Universities (MERUs), at par with IITs, IIMs, etc., will be set up and will aim to attain the highest global standards in quality education. Internalisation – India will be promoted as a global study destination providing premium education at affordable costs. An International Students Office at each HEI hosting foreign students will be set up to coordinate all matters relating to welcoming and supporting students arriving from abroad. Research/teaching collaborations and faculty/student exchanges with high-quality foreign institutions will be facilitated, and relevant mutually beneficial MOUs with foreign countries will be signed. Financial support for students – Financial assistance to students shall be made available through various measures. The National Scholarship Portal will be expanded to support, foster, and track the progress of students receiving scholarships. Private HEIs will be encouraged to offer larger numbers of free ships and scholarships to their students. A National Research Foundation (NRF) will be established as an apex body. The overarching goal of the NRF will be to enable a culture of research to permeate through our universities. Transforming the Regulatory System of Higher Education – Higher Education Commission of India (HECI) will be set up as a single overarching umbrella body the for entire higher education, excluding medical and legal education. Public and private higher education institutions will be governed by the same set of norms for regulation, accreditation and academic standards. Curbing Commercialisation of Education – Multiple mechanisms with checks and balances will combat and stop the commercialization of higher educationAll education institutions will be held to similar standards of audit and disclosure as a ‘not for profit’ entity. Surpluses, if any, will be reinvested in the educational sector. Effective Governance and Leadership for Higher Education Institutions – The definition of the university will allow a spectrum of institutions that range from Research-intensive universities to teaching-intensive universities and autonomous degree-granting colleges. The policy suggests through a suitable system of graded accreditation and graded autonomy, and in a phased manner over a period of 15 years, all HEIs in India will aim to become independent self-governing institutions pursuing innovation and excellence. Over a period of time, it is envisaged that every college would develop into either an autonomous degree-granting college, or a constituent college of a university. Open and Distance Learning: This will be expanded to play a significant role in increasing GER. Measures such as online courses and digital repositories, funding for research, improved student services, credit-based recognition of MOOCs, etc., will be taken to ensure it is at par with the highest quality in-class programmes. Online and Digital Education: A dedicated unit for the building of digital infrastructure, digital content and capacity building will be created in the MHRD to look after the e-education needs of both school and higher education. Technology in Education: An autonomous body, the National Educational Technology Forum (NETF), will be created to provide a platform for the free exchange of ideas on the use of technology to enhance learning, assessment, planning, administration. Professional Education: Preparation of professionals must involve an education in the ethic and importance of public purpose, an education in the discipline, and an education for practice. All institutions offering either professional or general education will aim to organically evolve into institutions/clusters offering both seamlessly, and in an integrated manner by 2030.

LEAD envisions a collaborative model of development, highlighting the need for liberal Arts and sciences education in various industries and in turn, ensuring that students get exposure beyond the classroom. The program aims to closely work together with organisations through various Internship/Project models outlined to help students enhance their diverse skill sets. LEAD includes the following modes of engagement: Summer Internships Summer Internships are the most popular category of internships among students as well as organisations. These internships allow students to develop their skills during their summer break, approximately for a duration of 8-12 weeks. These internships can either be remote or on-site at the organisation. Many a time, Summer Internships get converted to a Pre-Placement Offer upon completion of the internship which students can take up once they have graduated from Ashoka. Virtual Internships Virtual Internships are designed to ensure industry experience for students all around the academic year. Virtual Internships require the students to dedicate a stipulated number of hours per week (10-20 hours) in tandem with their academic schedule. Credit-Based Internships The Credit-Based Internship allows undergraduate and master’s students to earn academic credits while engaging in an Internship for a six-month period. Students gain practical hands-on experience at their internship while also taking part in reflective learning to make sense of their experience and how it impacts their future career goals. Students develop learning objectives, complete a post-internship reflective assignment, and design an internship learning portfolio demonstrating their internship outcomes under the supervision of a faculty member. YIF Experiential Learning Programme The Experiential Learning Module (ELM) is a core component of the Young India Fellowship (YIF) curriculum where Fellows work on real-life projects from diverse sectors in collaboration with partner organizations, institutions, and individuals. The ELM project amounts to 4 credits within the YIF Programme. The ELM commences in October and ends in May. Fridays and Saturdays in each academic session are designated ELM days, and a week each in October and February is designated as the ELM week which is utilized for fieldwork. Graduate Internships Graduate Internships are envisioned as a professional commitment that allows students to join as full-time interns for a period of 6-12 months after completing their Undergraduate and Postgraduate programs. It provides students with an opportunity to explore a specific industry of their choice and develop relevant skills. The internship serves as a foundation, or training period, leading to professional employment. Live Projects Live projects are a special category of engagement that involve research projects for a short span of time. These projects are usually undertaken by students in collaboration with an organisation or an independent researcher. Students dedicate stipulated hours per week (usually 10-20 hours) and submit their deliverables by the end of the project. These projects are offered throughout the year and their duration is decided as per the feasibility of the researcher, faculty, project manager, and student. Winter Internships Winter Internships provide students with an unparalleled opportunity to expand their horizons as they engage themselves in small projects (full-time) during the months of December and January. Students are encouraged to explore diverse opportunities and refresh their practical knowledge. Since the period of engagement is comparatively shorter, we encourage organizations to make an early offer for winter internships and start an engagement with Ashoka University. This helps organizations understand the talent pool at Ashoka. Shadow Programme In this program, students shadow a CXO/managerial level executive for a fixed duration to understand how they go about doing their daily tasks and deal with day-to-day conflicts. This will help students gain hands-on experience, learn about an organization, and build relationships. During the course of the program, students can attend workplace meetings, serve alongside the employer in volunteer work, discuss industry trends, and engage with the organisation’s mission.

At Ashoka University, we have come across brilliant students who pushed us to make tough choices. We are particularly impressed with the quality of questions from those who had worked on wider projects beyond the curriculum.

I look forward to Genpact continuing to be an active recruiter from the YIF programme going forward.” President and CEO, Genpact  “At Dr Reddy’s, we were looking out for young leaders who not only had the zeal to learn  but also brought unique & creative perspectives to the table. This required an exposure  to diversity in education as well as thought process which the Fellowship provides. Every  YIF recruit now on-board with us has moved from adapting to value-adding at a swift  pace & are already creating a niche for themselves in the organisation. We value the spirit  and grit that they bring to the workplace.” VP Human Resources, Dr Reddy’s Labs  “The Ashokan we hired has truly been one of the best hires we’ve ever made and part of the credit should go to Ashoka University.

Students might come to Ashoka already determined to specialise in one subject, but they are not expected to declare their Major until the middle of the second year. Delivered in collaboration with    Ashoka University, in compliance with UGC guidelines, offers a 3-year Bachelor’s Degree programme.  It also offers a year-long Postgraduate Diploma in Advanced Studies and Research (DipASR). All undergraduates graduating with Bachelor’s Degrees at the end of their third year, or who have completed by that time at least academic 92 credits of their degree programme, are eligible for admission into the Postgraduate Diploma in Advanced Studies and Research programme, also known as the Ashoka Scholars Programme (ASP). Students who need to complete up to 8 credits of their undergraduate degree must do so within the first semester of the ASP. All students who fall into either of these categories must formally apply for admission to the ASP towards the end of the Spring semester of their third year. The exact date will be circulated by the OAA.    YIF is Ashoka University’s fully residential one-year multidisciplinary liberal studies in postgraduate diploma programme. First of its kind in India, the Fellowship brings together the brightest students from diverse academic and social backgrounds, who are then guided by distinguished scholars and leaders of our times. They are taught to develop critical thinking and writing skills, understand leadership and group dynamics and get exposure to a wide range of subjects. This transformational experience turns them into problem-solvers and collaborators who are an asset to organisations and society. Delivered in collaboration with    Ashoka University’s MA programme in Liberal Studies is a 32-credit, a one-year programme offered to students who have graduated with a diploma in Liberal Studies from the Young India Fellowship, and have been accepted by an Ashoka University faculty mentor to work on a specific research project as a graduate assistant. This programme’s interdisciplinary module contains coursework from a variety of disciplines, including Humanities, Social Sciences, Behavioural Sciences, and Natural Sciences. The University aims to train students to think critically about their disciplines of interest while deriving insights from other disciplines. The MA programme in Liberal Studies also helps students to prepare their graduate applications.     Ashoka University’s Masters programme in Economics has been developed to provide students with the opportunity to be trained in modern Economics by highly qualified economists. Applications opened for the first batch of Masters in Economics students in February this year.     Ashoka University’s MA programme in English mentors students to think across boundaries of genre, culture and time. The programme’s curriculum introduces students to a wide array of texts, theories and disciplinary formations from around the world. The programme lets students pursue courses in other departments at the University for integrated education.                                                                                                                “Ashoka University is fostering a league of professionals that will write the future of the modern workplace. The curriculum at Ashoka encourages learning within and outside the classroom in unconventional ways, which sets Ashoka’s graduates class apart in their ability to communicate, think critically, solve complex problems, and be leaders in their respective domains. Graduates of Ashoka at WNS display a sophisticated recognition of how data drives our world, and are analytical thinkers who make for great team players. Group CEO, WNS services  “When one considers the pace at which technology is changing, university graduates will need to be equipped for future jobs that have not yet been invented. ‘One size fits all’ education has created graduates that are not directly employable. With well rounded, broad education, graduates from Ashoka University are equipped for the uncertain business environment that needs multi-dimensional thinkers. While the job specifics can be taught, the graduates from Ashoka University have shown the ability to clearly communicate ideas, analyze data, work in teams & solve problems. They are socially sensitive individuals who are working successfully across seemingly disparate businesses. At Ashoka University, we have come across brilliant students who pushed us to make tough choices. We are particularly impressed with the quality of questions from those who had worked on wider projects beyond the curriculum. The candidates who joined DB Private Bank last year are doing very well both in their individual roles as well as active members of a team.” CEO, Deutsche Bank  “I am delighted with the Fellows we have absorbed into Genpact over the last few years. They are different as they have a broader perspective and are able to connect the dots; they are much better at communication – structuring and articulating their thoughts and ideas. YIF graduates are also more curious and hungry to learn – a key differentiator in a world that is changing much faster than ever before. I look forward to Genpact continuing to be an active recruiter from the YIF programme going forward.” President and CEO, Genpact  “At Dr Reddy’s, we were looking out for young leaders who not only had the zeal to learn  but also brought unique & creative perspectives to the table. This required an exposure  to diversity in education as well as thought process which the Fellowship provides. Every  YIF recruit now on-board with us has moved from adapting to value-adding at a swift  pace & are already creating a niche for themselves in the organisation. We value the spirit  and grit that they bring to the workplace.” VP Human Resources, Dr Reddy’s Labs  “The Ashokan we hired has truly been one of the best hires we’ve ever made and part of the credit should go to Ashoka University. He was keen to learn and also contribute and make an impact on the Organisation’s goals. Over the last year or so, I’m delighted to say that he has excelled at almost every new task and challenge, and has fit into our culture seamlessly.” Founder & Group Executive Chairman, MakeMyTrip  “Students from Ashoka are bright, self-starters, and confident. They worked on all aspects of our projects – from training field staff for data collection to learning firsthand data management skills, and even participated in government meetings. Their enthusiasm to learn and eagerness to make a difference distinguishes them from their peers, and we have been glad to have had the opportunity to work with this group and continuing our relationship.” Executive Director, J-PAL South Asia at IFMR                   The Ashoka Internship Cell, an extension of the Career Development Office provides exceptional opportunities for young Ashokans to hone their skills for the dynamic career ahead. This past year, Ashokans interned with prestigious organisations such as Spencer Stuart, DE Shaw & Co., HUL, ITC, Ab Inbev, Axis Bank, IndusInsights, Adobe, JSW Group, SAP Labs, Amuse Labs, MSL Group, The Print, and Doctors Without Borders. Some of the roles offered to the students were Financial Research Intern, Business Analyst Intern, Risk Analytics Intern, Software Engineering Intern, Quality Assurance Intern, Donor Relations and Communications Intern, Operations & Strategy Intern, Content Writing Intern, Digital Health Intern, Research and Content Management Intern.

They are paid programs and are open to participants outside Ashoka University. This year the CWC hosted four summer schools on: Research Writing in the Humanities and Social Sciences, Academic Writing in the Sciences, Introduction to Editing and Proofreading, and Academic Publishing. Combining both academic and creative themes and topics, these workshops are held with the objective of imparting practical skills and tenets of critical thinking that could be used by the participants in achieving their writing goals. CWC Summer School on Research Writing in the Humanities and Social Sciences (June 26-30, 2023) The Summer School helped participants develop a portion of writing along with equipping them with tools and techniques useful for research writing in academic and professional settings. Sessions will cover original contribution, framing research questions, literature review, research ethics, research methods, and components of a research paper and thesis. A key feature of the school is the use and applicability of ethnographic research methods such as interviews, observations, field notes, and thick descriptions across varied research settings. CWC Summer School on Academic Writing in the Sciences (June 26-27, 2023) The workshop helped participants understand academic formats and styles of writing. It focussed on the basic elements of academic writing in the sciences and will discuss topics such as finding a research story and the structure of an academic paper, writing abstracts, use of language, self-editing tips, referencing, and citations. CWC Summer School on Introduction to Editing and Proofreading (June 25, 2023) The Summer School introduced participants to the practice of editing and proofreading. The session will address the difference between editing and proofreading, kinds of errors, levels of editing, and proofreaders’ marks including abbreviations and symbols. The workshop was intended for anyone interested in editing and proofreading. The workshop was not purely academic in its scope, and included professional editing for publishing industry, content writing etc. CWC Summer School on Academic Publishing (July 3-4, 2023) This two-day Summer School introduced the participants to how to get started with publishing in various formats within academia: including research articles, books, reviews and monographs. It involved familiarizing the participants with every aspect of the publishing process: starting from the nitty gritty of shortlisting/ selecting a journal/publisher and submission, corresponding with editors and proofreaders, to various stages of peer-reviewing, revisions, proofreading, and post-publication priorities. The workshop was designed to cater to an audience at various stages of their career in academia.     [CFP now closed] The CWC’s annual conference brings together educators, scholars, students and activists working in the field of education. Our first conference in 2017-18, Reflections on Writing, critically examined the idea of writing in university spaces. The 2018-19 conference focused on Inclusive Pedagogy: Teaching and Learning Practices in Higher Education in India. CWC’s 2019-20 Conference ‘Challenges/Strategies in Teaching English for Academic Purposes (EAP) in Higher Education in India’ was postponed due to Covid-19 and is to be held online in April 2021. On 23rd-34th April 2021 CWC hosted its 3rd Annual Conference titled Challenges/Strategies in Teaching English for Academic Purposes (EAP) in Higher Education in India‘.

Panels ‘Teaching Methods and Curriculum Building’ and ‘The Hetergenous Classroom: Strategies for Inclusion’ deserve special mention for initiating the task of data collection in the field of teaching writing in India. The conference closed on a high note with Prof. Giridhar Rao’s (Azim Premji University) keynote address  chaired by Prof. Prakash Padakannaya (Christ University, Bangalore). CWC’s 2022-23 upcoming conference titled Writing ‘Data’: Interdisciplinary Perspectives aims to bring together scholars and teachers across disciplines whose work engages with varied aspects of writing methods & pedagogies as they interact with and respond to data and computation methods in their scholarship, research, and teaching.    To address research writing needs of Ashoka students  pursuing research projects and dissertations, the Winter School was started in 2021. The winter School is a five day long program organized during the winter break and has series of workshops, lectures and individual and group writing sessions on various aspects of research writing, including methodology writing, and science writing and communication.

The process of creating truly global citizens is well underway at the sports fields in the University. This unique process does not only provide state-of-the-art sports facilities but also encourages sports to be taken up by one and all. True transformation can only take place when students are able to push themselves out of their comfort zone. This process demands learning more about themselves before they even attempt to change anything around them.      Vision Sports and Exercise at Ashoka University works with the vision and objective to create a healthy and holistic life for its students. We channelise sports to enable students in learning and honing life skills and values such as discipline, mutual respect, punctuality, camaraderie, leadership, teamwork, mental and emotional balance. Apart from just trying to make every student physically active, we help them excel in their chosen sport.

The three editions of our Annual Sports Fest AGNEEPATH, gave a great platform to students at National level. Previously organized Annual Sports Meet saw enthusiastic participation from undergraduates and Young India Fellows. Students, faculty and staff together participate in official runs in Delhi like the Airtel Delhi Half Marathon, Ashoka Run, Intra-University, Inter-University leagues and National Level tournaments. Furthermore, our students are engaged in experiential learning in the outdoors, during different treks organized by Ashoka. Through such activities, students encourage each other by being actively involved in organisation and participation.   For the coming year, gear up to represent Ashoka University and participate at various International, National, All-India University tournaments and Banyan League (A collaborative sports initiative of 4 Universities – OP Jindal, Shiv Nadar, BML Munjal and Ashoka to keep the students engaged in 9 sporting events around the year). Our sports teams further represent Ashoka University at various Inter-University Sports festivals/championships organised at various colleges and universities like IIT (Delhi), BITS Pilani (Goa) etc.      There are a lot of on-campus sports events for the students to participate in like APL i.e. Football league, Basketball league, Badminton league and Intra-Batch tournaments for almost all sports available on campus. Students have ample opportunity on a regular basis, to keep the spirit of sports alive Needless to say, it is their passion and commitment that will make things happen and ensure that Ashoka University is known for its sports culture.      The Sports and Exercise Office also facilitates and promotes the Sporting ethos on campus by assisting the sports related clubs. Currently we have four registered clubs: Cycling club, Yoga Club, Sports Enthusiast Club and Special Olympic Bharat: Ashoka Sector Club. The clubs engage the students in various physical and voluntary activities throughout the year by organising on campus and off-campus events.

491,"Ashoka	University	Guidelines	on	Protecting	Freedom	of	Expression		1. Introduction	1.1	The	 central	 purposes	 of	 a	 University	 are	 the	 pursuit	 of	 truth,	 the	 discovery	 of	 new	knowledge	 through	 scholarship	 and	 research,	 the	 teaching	 and	 general	 development	 of	students,	and	the	transmission	of	knowledge	and	learning	to	society	at	large.	Free	inquiry	and	free	expression	within	the	University	community	are	indispensable	to	the	achievement	of	these	goals.	The	freedom	to	teach	and	to	learn	depends	upon	the	creation	of	appropriate	conditions	and	opportunities	not	only	in	classrooms	and	lecture	halls	but	also	on	the	campus	as	a	whole.		1.2	Since	rigid	codification	and	relentless	administration	of	rules	and	regulations	are	not	appropriate	 to	a	 University	community,	 the	guidelines	that	 follow	 serve	 mainly	 to	 clarify	commonly	accepted	standards	of	conduct	within	the	University.	The	University	community	referred	 to	 above	 consists	 of	 every	 person	 associated	 with	 the	 University,	 whether	 a	student,	faculty,	administrative	staff	or	other	employees	and	contractual	workers.		2. Scope	of	These	Guidelines	2.1	These	Guidelines	govern	the	conduct	of:	University	students,	regardless	of	enrolment	status;	faculty;	staff;	and	third	parties	to	the	extent	of	their	interaction	with	the	University	(i.e.,	 non-members	 of	 the	 University	 community,	 such	 as	 vendors,	 alumni/ae,	 visitors,	 or	local	residents).	2.2	Third	 parties	 are	 both	 protected	 by	 and	 subject	 to	 these	Guidelines.	 A	 third	 party	may	make	a	complaint	or	report	of	a	violation	of	these	Guidelines	committed	by	a	member	of	the	University	community.		2.3	These	Guidelines	apply	to	 conduct	 that	 occurs	 on	 University	 property	 (i.e.,	 on	campus)	 and	 also	 applies	 to	 conduct	 that	 occurs	 off	 University	 property	 (i.e.,	 off	 campus)	when	 the	 conduct	 is	 associated	 with	 a	 University-sponsored	 program	 or	 activity,	 such	 as	travel,	 research,	 or	 internship	 programs	 or	 when	 such	 conduct	 may	 have	 a	 continuing	adverse	 effect	 or	 could	 create	 a	 hostile	 environment	 on	 campus.	 Judgments	 about	 these	matters	will	depend	on	facts	of	an	individual	case.	2.4	These	Guidelines	also	apply	to	the	use	of	university	infrastructure.	3. Academic	Integrity	3.1	The	 ability	 of	 the	 University	 to	 achieve	 its	 purposes	 depends	 upon	 the	 quality	 and	integrity	 of	 the	 academic	 work	 that	 its	 faculty,	 staff,	 and	 students	 perform.	 Academic	freedom	 can	 flourish	 only	 in	 a	 community	 of	scholars	 that	recognizes	 that	 intellectual	integrity,	 with	 its	 accompanying	 rights	 and	 responsibilities,	 lies	 at	 the	 heart	 of	 its	 mission.	Observing	honesty	in	one's	work,	words,	and	actions	is	a	principle	to	which	all	members	of	the	community	are	required	to	subscribe.			4. Statement	on	Freedom	of	Expression	4.1	Because	 the	 University	 is	 committed	 to	 free	 and	 open	 inquiry	 in	 all	 matters,	 it	guarantees	 all	 members	 of	 the	 University	 community	 the	 broadest	 possible	 latitude	 to	speak,	write,	listen,	challenge,	and	learn.	Except	insofar	as	limitations	on	that	freedom	are	necessary	to	the	functioning	of	the	university,	as	detailed	in	section	4.2,	Ashoka	University	fully	 respects	 and	 supports	 the	 freedom	 of	 all	 members	 of	 the	 University	 community	 to	discuss	any	problem	that	presents	itself.	The	ideas	of	different	members	of	the	University	community	 will	 often	 and	 quite	 naturally	 conflict.	 But	 it	 is	 not	 the	 proper	 role	 of	 the	University	 to	 attempt	 to	 shield	 individuals	 from	 ideas	 and	 opinions	 they	 find	 unwelcome,	disagreeable,	or	even	deeply	offensive	except	when	it	violates	norms	of	mutual	respect	as	detailed	in	section	5.1.		4.2	The	 freedom	 to	 debate	 and	 discuss	 the	 merits	 of	 competing	 ideas	 does	 not,	 of	course,	 mean	 that	 individuals	 may	 say	 whatever	 they	 wish,	 wherever	 they	 wish.	 The	University	may	 restrict	 expression	 that	 violates	 the	law,	that	falsely	 defames	 a	 specific	individual,	that	constitutes	a	genuine	threat	of	or	incitement	to	violence	or	harassment,	or	that	 unjustifiably	 invades	 substantial	 privacy	 or	 confidentiality	 interests.	In	 addition,	 the	University	may	reasonably	regulate	the	time,	place,	and	manner	of	expression	to	ensure	that	it	does	not	disrupt	the	ordinary	activities	of	the	University.	But	these	are	narrow	exceptions	to	 the	 general	 principle	 of	 freedom	 of	 expression,	and	 it	is	 vitally	 important	 that	 these	exceptions	 never	 be	applied	in	 a	 manner	that	 is	 inconsistent	 with	 the	 University’s	commitment	to	a	completely	free	and	open	discussion	of	ideas.	4.3	In	a	word,	the	University’s	fundamental	commitment	is	to	the	principle	that	debate	or	deliberation	may	not	be	suppressed	because	the	ideas	put	forth	are	thought	by	some	or	even	 by	 most	 members	 of	 the	 University	 community	 to	 be	 offensive	 or	 immoral.	 Indeed,	fostering	the	ability	of	members	of	the	University	community	to	engage	in	such	debate	and	deliberation	in	an	effective	and	responsible	manner	is	an	essential	part	of	the	University’s	educational	mission.	4.4	As	 a	 corollary	 to	 the	 University’s	 commitment	 to	 protect	 and	 promote	 free	expression,	 members	 of	 the	 University	 community	must	 also	 act	 in	 conformity	 with	 the	principle	 of	 free	 expression.	 Although	 members	 of	 the	 University	 community	 are	 free	 to	criticize	and	contest	the	views	expressed	on	campus,	and	to	criticize	and	contest	speakers	who	 are	 invited	 to	 express	 their	 views	 on	campus,	 they	 may	 not	 obstruct	 or	 otherwise	interfere	with	the	freedom	of	others	to	express	views	they	reject	or	even	loathe.	To	this	end,	the	University	has	a	solemn	responsibility	not	only	to	promote	a	lively	and	fearless	freedom	of	debate	and	deliberation,	but	also	to	protect	that	freedom	when	others	attempt	to	restrict	it.	5. Respect	for	Others	5.1	As	an	intellectual	community,	Ashoka	attaches	great	value	to	freedom	of	expression	and	 vigorous	 debate,	 but	 it	 also	 attaches	 great	 importance	 to	 mutual	 respect,	 and	 it	deplores	 expressions	 of	 hatred	 directed	 against	 any	 individual	 or	 group.	Respect	 for	 the	rights	and	 sensibilities	 of	 each	 other	 is	 essential	 in	 preserving	 the	 spirit	 of	 community	 at	Ashoka.	Actions	 that	make	 the	 atmosphere	 intimidating,	 threatening,	 or	 hostile	 to	individuals	 are	 therefore	 regarded	 as	 serious	 offenses.	 Abusive	 or	 harassing	behaviour,	verbal	 or	 physical,	 which	 demeans,	 intimidates,	 threatens,	 or	 injures	 another	 because	 of	personal	 characteristics	 or	 beliefs	 or	 their	 expression,	may	 be	subject	 to	 University	disciplinary	procedure.	 Examples	 of	 personal	 characteristics	 or	 beliefs	 include	 but	 are	 not	limited	 to	 sex,	 sexual	 orientation,	 gender	 identity,	 race,	 ethnicity,	 national	 origin,	 religion,	and	disability.	The	University	calls	on	all	its	members	to	display	the	appropriate	sensitivity	and	to	challenge	expressions	of	racial,	gender	or	ethnic	bias	whenever	they	encounter	them.	6. Peaceful	Dissent,	Protests,	and	Demonstrations	6.1	Free	 speech	 and	 peaceable	 assembly	 are	 basic	 requirements	 of	 the	 University	 as	 a	centre	for	 free	 inquiry	 and	 the	 search	 for	 knowledge	 and	 insight.	 These	 rights	 involve	 a	concurrent	 obligation	 on	the	 part	 of	 all	 members	 of	 the	 University,	 guests,	 and	 visitors	 to	maintain	on	the	campus	an	atmosphere	conducive	to	scholarly	pursuits	and	to	respect	the	rights	of	all	individuals.	6.2	In	 view	 of	Ashoka's	 obligation	 to	 promote	 the	 free	 expression	 of	 all	views,	 the	campus	is	open	to	any	speaker	whom	students	or	members	of	the	faculty	have	invited	and	for	whom	official	arrangements	to	speak	have	been	made	with	the	University.	The	right	of	free	 speech	 in	 a	 university	 also	 includes	 the	 right	 to	 acts	 of	 peaceful	 dissent,	 protests	 in	peaceable	assembly,	orderly	demonstrations,	and	the	distribution	of	leaflets.		6.3	These	are	permitted	on	the	Ashoka	campus,	subject	to	approval	from	the	University	administration	as	 to	 schedule	 and	 location	only.	In	 asking	 groups	 and	 individuals	 to	 seek	prior	approval	for	schedule	and	location,	the	University's	goal	is	not	to	restrict	free	speech	or	peaceable	assembly.	Rather,	it	is	to	give	the	University	the	opportunity	to	provide	space	that	accommodates	the	reasonable	needs	of	both	the	University	community	and	those	engaged	in	acts	of	speech	or	protest.		6.4	The	University	reserves	the	right	to	determine	the	time,	place,	and	manner	of	all	such	activities.	Whenever	appropriate,	the	Office	the	VC	or	Pro-VC,	with	assistance	from	and	in	consultation	with	appropriate	departmental	heads,	will	designate	clearly	marked	areas	for	protests	and	demonstrations.	The	University	reserves	the	right	to	refuse	permission	to	use	a	particular	area	for	protests	or	demonstrations.		6.5	It	 is	 a	 violation	 of	 these	Guidelines	whenever	 any	 individual	 prevents,	 or	wilfully	attempts	 to	 prevent,	 the	 orderly	 conduct	 of	 a	 University	 function	 or	 activity,	 such	 as	lectures,	meetings,	interviews,	ceremonies,	and	public	events;	or	blocks,	or	wilfully	attempts	to	block,	the	legitimate	activities	of	any	person	on	the	campus	or	in	any	University	building	or	facility.	6.6	Whenever	 a	 member	 of	 the	 University	 community	violates	 these	Guidelines,	 that	individual	will	be	subject	to	University	discipline.	Decisions	to	invoke	University	disciplinary	action	in	the	course	of	a	protest	or	demonstration	will	be	made	after	due	warning	and	such	decisions	will	be	made	by	officers	of	the	University.	A	third	party	may	also	be	permanently	barred	from	the	University	or	subject	to	other	restrictions	for	failing	to	comply	with	these	Guidelines.		7. Political	Campaigning	7.1	Members	of	the	University	community,	as	individuals	and	groups,	have	the	right	to	exercise	 their	 freedom	 of	 expression	 and	 association.	 Under	 law,	 however,	 the	 University	may	not	""participate	in,	or	intervene	in	any	political	campaign	on	behalf	of	(or	in	opposition	to)	 any	 candidate	 for	 [any]	 public	 office""	 and	 ""no	 substantial	 part	 of	 the	 activities""	 of	 the	University	 may	 be	 directed	 to	 influencing	 legislation.	 The	 University	 may	 not	 endorse,	 or	provide	or	solicit	financial	or	other	support	for,	candidates	or	political	organizations.		8. Ashoka	University	Name,	Marks,	and	Seal	8.1	No	individual	or	organization	may	use	the	University’s	name,	logos,	restricted	images,	or	 other	 identifiers	 (“marks”),	 or	 any	 marks	 that	 suggest	Ashoka	University	 or	 any	department,	school	or	centre	of	Ashoka	University	except	to	the	extent	such	individual	or	organization	 has	 been	 authorized	 by	 the	 proper	 University	 officials	 or	 as	 permitted	 under	trademark	 law.	The	 Pro-Vice	 Chancellor	 of	 the	 University	 is	 responsible	 for	 the	 general	oversight	and	administration	of	the	University’s	trademark	policies.		8.2	The	above	stipulation	shall	not	apply	to	an	academic	work	submitted	for	publication	by	 any	 person	 to	 whom	 these	 Guidelines	 apply,	 such	 as	 an	 article	 in	 a	 peer-reviewed	academic	journal,	an	independent	monograph,	or	as	part	of	a	collection	of	works.		8.3	Encouragement	of	an	interest	in	public	affairs	and	the	furtherance	of	a	sense	of	social	responsibility	have	long	been	considered	important	elements	of	a	liberal	arts	education.	The	University	 continues	 to	 consider	 self-chosen	 participation	 in	 political	 and	 social	 action	 by	individuals	 and	 groups	 to	 be	 a	 valuable	 part	 of	 the	 educational	 experience	 it	 seeks	 to	encourage.	 Such	 activities	 on	 the	 part	 of	 individuals	 or	 groups	 do	 not,	 and	 should	 not	 be	taken	to,	imply	commitment	of	the	University	to	any	partisan	political	position	or	point	of	view.	As	 such,	 for	 articles,	 opinion	 pieces,	 quotations,	and/or	 appearances	 in	 the	 popular	media	or	in	other	public	events	such	as	political,	social	or	religious	gatherings	or	organised	functions,	it	is	understood	that	the	views	held	by	the	author	or	participant	are	personal	and	not	those	of	the	university.		8.4	All	written	materials	that	take	the	form	of	petitions,	letters	of	protest,	or	declarations	should	have	prominent	disclaimers	as	headers	and	footers,	examples	of	which	follow	below:	“We	the	undersigned,	speaking	in	our	individual	capacity….”	“The	views	expressed	above	are	those	of	the	signatories	alone	and	do	not	reflect	those	of	Ashoka	University.”	8.5	The	use	of	the	seal	of	the	University	on	publications,	manufactured	articles,	and	the	like	 is	 prohibited,	 except	 when	 specifically	 authorized	 by	 the	 University.	 Applications	 for	such	authorization	must	be	made	to	the	Registrar	of	the	University.			9. Computer	and	Network	Use	9.1	Ashoka	University	makes	available	to	its	community	members	electronic	and	digital	data	 and	 network	 resources,	 including	 shared	 information	 technology	 resources	 that	 use	text,	 voice,	 images,	 and	 video	 to	 deliver	 information.	 These	 resources	 are	 to	 be	 used	 in	 a	manner	consistent	with	University	policy	and	the	law.	9.2	All	uses	of	the	University's	information	technology	and	network	resources	are	subject	to	 the	 regulations	 and	 policies	 set	 forth	 by	 the	University	 administration.	The	 IT	 policy	document	also	provides	information	regarding	copyright	and	other	laws	that	are	potentially	applicable	 to	 certain	 uses	 of	 the	 University's	 IT	 and	 digital	 resources	 and	 network	 access.	Members	of	the	University	community	are	expected	to	be	familiar	with	and	adhere	to	the	regulations	thus	defined.		Members	of	the	University	community	who	engage	in	any	illegal	or	 fraudulent	 use	 of	 the	 University's	 information	 technology	 resources,	 including	infringement	 of	 copyright-protected	 materials,	 may	 be	 subject	 to	 disciplinary	 action,	including	the	termination	or	suspension	of	network	privileges.		9.3	All	 actions	 by	 a	 member	 of	 the	 University	 community	 that	 involve	 the	 use	 of	 the	University’s	 computing	 and	 network	 resources	 from	 a	 remote	 location,	 including	 but	 not	limited	to	accessing	email	accounts,	will	be	deemed	to	have	occurred	on	campus.		9.4	Regulations	 governing	 use	 of	 the	 University's	 name	 and	 property	 and	 political	activities	 and	 community	 use	 of	 University	 resources	 also	 apply	 to	 use	 of	 the	 University's	information	technology	resources.	9.5	Members	 of	 the	 University	 community	 may	 not	 use	 University	 IT	 and	 network	resources	 for	 commercial	 (including	 consulting)	 purposes,	 unless	 they	 have	 received	permission	to	do	so	from	the	University	Administration;	rather,	they	should	use	information	technology	resources,	Internet	service	providers,	and	computer	hosts	outside	the	University.

492,"19 FACULTY POLICIES I MARCH 2018IPR Policy 1. Preamble: a. Intellectual Property (IP) is new and creative work resulting from research, innovation and teaching in any discipline including, but not limited to, natural sciences, social sciences, humanities, performing arts, engineering, etc. b. Such IP includes, for instance, (a) process to synthesize a new material, (b) new design of a product or service, (c) an algorithm, software, or an “app” to achieve a certain computational, communication or control function, as also (d) teaching and learning resources and (e) academic books and published articles. c. Documentation of IP may take the form of a research article, book, thesis, project report, drawing, lecture notes, lab notes, documentary film, etc. d. Protection of IP will, however, take the form of a copyright, patent or trademark registration depending upon the IP . In particular, research articles, books, theses, drawings, lecture notes, lab notes, documentary film are copyrighted, while (new) inventions, designs, algorithms, etc. are patented. e. Ashoka University is a research-driven university, it expects its faculty and students to spend significant fraction of its time engaged in research and innovation, while disseminating research outcome in the form of publications of journal articles, books, or conference presentations. f. Even as Ashoka University aims to offer world-class modern undergraduate and post-graduate programmes, its curricula, pedagogy and teaching and learning materials are expected to be creative and uniquely different. g. It is expected that in time to come significant IP will be generated by the university’s faculty and students. It is, therefore, important for the university to protect rights to all such IP so that interests of the faculty, students and 20 ASHOKA UNIVERSITYthe university are adequately protected. This document on university policy on IP rights is in response to that need. 2. About this document: a. This document identifies all issues that concern generation of IP by the faculty, staff and students of Ashoka University, protection of IP in the form of patent, copyright, trademark, etc., and the licensing of its IP rights to third parties for commercialization. b. This document is subject to the IPR laws of India, such as Trade and Merchandise Marks Act,1958, Patent Act, 1970, Copy Rights Act, 1957 and Designs Act, 2000 etc. and their amendments. c. In doing so, this document outlines the university’s policy towards: i. Publication of research outcomes in journals or at conferences or in the form of books, ii. Establishing ownership of IP created by its faculty, staff and students, or co-ownership in case research is sponsored by a third party or research is conducted in collaboration with researchers from another organization, iii. Licensing of, or transfer of, IP rights to third parties for commercialization and consequent sharing of revenue with co-inventors, iv. Dissemination and enforcement of IPR policy, including its reflection in employment contracts, in agreements concerning research grants or collaboration with other organization, or in contracts with vendors supplying goods and services to the university, v. Academic recognition to faculty towards promotions or tenure decisions for generation of IP in the form of a patent, etc. vi. Establishing a university-wide committee to manage all aspects of IP , including generation, protection and licensing of IP , together with budgetary and administrative support needed therefore. The document should be periodically reviewed, and changes made depending upon need and experience gained.21 FACULTY POLICIES I MARCH 20183. Definitions: In this document the following definitions shall apply, a. “The University” means Ashoka University. b. “Member” means full-time faculty (including tenured faculty, faculty on tenure-track, “visiting faculty”, & “faculty on-contract”) and full-time staff employed by the University. It also includes students enrolled on a full-time basis in an undergraduate (UG), post-graduate (PG), or doctoral (PhD) or post-doctoral fellowship (PDF) programme. Part-time faculty, Guest faculty, Adjunct faculty or students enrolled in any UG/PG/PhD program on a part-time basis are also considered “members” but only to the extent of their engagement with the university, and not outside. c. “IP generated” means IP generated by a member during the member’s tenure/engagement with the University. d. “IP rights” means ownership of IP , together with identification of list of members who have contributed to creation of such IP . e. “Tenure” means to the actual period of employment or studentship. f. “Cooling period” means to the one year period immediately following termination of employment/studentship of the member. g. “Infrastructure facilities” means physical infrastructure such as laboratories, lecture rooms, IT resources (including computer and storage servers, specialized software), and other services provided by university (such as HR, Finance & Accounts). Infrastructure facilities will exclude use of the Library, access to Internet and email services and other facilities such as on-campus housing, gymnasium. h. “Employee’s obligations to the University” means work carried out by a member as part of deliverables expected of him/her as part of employment or studies. This includes research, teaching, administration, or service to the university. i. “Sponsor” means an organization that commits itself to 22 ASHOKA UNIVERSITYproviding funds, equipment, etc. for a defined, time-bound activity at the university such as basic/applied research, consulting assignment, training programme, etc. 4. Applicability of IPR Policy: a. This policy on IP rights (IPR) will apply to full-time members of the university (and this includes faculty, staff and students). b. This policy on IPR will also apply to all part-time “Guest” or “ Adjunct” faculty or part-time students, but only to the extent of their engagement with the university. c. This IPR policy will also have a bearing on an agreement that the university signs with a sponsoring organization, collaborating organization or with a vendor. 5. Ownership of IP: a. Published Materials i. The university recognizes that globally faculty and students prefer to publish their research outcomes or creative works in the form of journal articles, papers presented in conferences, newspaper articles, or as books. They do so in order to ensure that the research outcome is disseminated globally, and in the shortest possible time. ii. As a consequence, the university encourages its members to publish their findings in journals, conferences, newspaper articles, or as books, etc. even as the university recognizes that relevant publishers will own copyright to such works. In all such cases, the University will not seek to own rights to such IP . iii. However, members should understand that publication in a journal or at a conference, or as a book may jeopardize any effort later to file a patent application. b. Creative Common License i. The university also recognizes that globally faculty and students sometimes prefer to place their creative works under one of the ‘creative commons licenses that allows members to retain copyright while allowing others to 23 FACULTY POLICIES I MARCH 2018copy, distribute, and use their work. They do so with a view to contribute to growing and collective wealth of knowledge for everyone to freely use. ii. As a consequence, the university encourages its members to share their creative works under creative commons licenses, while retaining copyright to the IP . In particular, the University will not seek to own rights to such IP . iii. Here again, members should understand that placing their creative works in Creative Commons may jeopardize any effort later to file a patent application. c. Thesis /Dissertation i. As is the practice in universities elsewhere, the copyright to thesis/dissertation will be owned by the student. ii. Note, however, copyright pertains only to thesis document itself (or equivalently to the form in which the research findings or creative work are documented), whereas ownership of invention/development described in the thesis will be governed by IPR policy statements made elsewhere in this policy document. d. Other Creative Works i. The university recognizes that there are forms of creative works for which the copyright will either vest with the creator(s) or with the organization that publishes them. Consequently, the University will not seek ownership to such works. Such creative works include, but is not limited to, blogs, newspaper articles, films, documentaries, music compositions, teaching and learning materials, etc. ii. Unless otherwise agreed to, under the conditions listed above, the University will seek assignment of copyright to such creative works if it is specifically commissioned by the University by way of funds, ideas, etc. e. IP Generated by Faculty or students; i. The university will seek to own, and thus protect, all IP generated by its faculty or students as part of their obligations to the University. This is, however, subject to certain conditions set forth below.24 ASHOKA UNIVERSITYii. The university will not seek to own, nor protect, any IP generated by its members which is (a) unrelated to their obligations to the university, and does not use university’s infrastructure. IP generated from a project funded by a sponsor will be owned by the university if significant infrastructure facilities of the university are used. However, depending upon the level of funding and research contribution by sponsor, co-ownership of IP may be negotiated by the university and incorporated into an agreement before the project is started. f. IP Generated out of Research Collaboration i. Ownership of IP generated as a result of research collaboration with researchers from another organization that is not funding the research will be decided mutually anytime during course of collaboration. g. IP Generated from Consulting Assignment: i. IP generated from a consulting assignment awarded to a member by a sponsor will generally be owned by the sponsor. ii. However, if significant resource(s) of the university are used, or if the assignment is only partly funded by sponsor, the university will negotiate with the sponsor co-ownership of IP so generated. h. Academic and Teaching Programmes: i. For every academic (or teaching) programme offered, the university will own the IP concerning its curriculum (viz. description of admission & graduation requirements, programme structure, pre-requisites, description of individual courses together with associated credits, standardized lab experiments together with lab manual, pedagogy, etc.). ii. However, copyright to all teaching/learning resources developed by member(s) shall vest with the member(s). This includes lecture notes or slides, tests, quizzes, home assignments, learning materials, etc.25 FACULTY POLICIES I MARCH 2018i. IP Generated by start-ups: i. IP generated by start-ups that are part of University’s incubation programme shall be owned by the start-up. ii. This will remain so even though members are engaged with a start-up company on a part-time basis or full-time basis on leave from the university (this is also covered by policy statement concerning IP generated during a member’s visit to another organization on leave from the university). j. IP Generated by Contractors, Consultants and Vendors i. All IP generated by contractors, consultants or vendors as part of their engagement with the University will be owned by the University, unless agreed to otherwise as part of the contract. k. Access to IP owned by the University i. As a matter of IPR policy the University allows its members free access to all IP that it owns (or co-owns with another organization) and its use for purpose of teaching and continued research at the university. l. IP generated by members while visiting another Organisation: i. Any IP generated by any of its members while visiting another organization on leave from the university will be subject to the IPR policy of that organization. ii. However, if the IP so generated has its origin while working at the University prior to the visit, the University and the organization may enter into an agreement to co-own IP or assign IP to either organization. 6. Protecting IP Rights: a. Every time an inventor (or group of co-inventors) identify and propose that a certain research outcome be protected by the University, the University will follow a defined process to determine whether it will seek protection of the proposed IP in the form of a patent (or copyright, or trade mark or design).26 ASHOKA UNIVERSITYb. If the university decides to proceed with protection of IP , the university shall put in the requisite time, effort and funds and seek protection of IP within India and/or in other regions. c. The concerned member(s) will, on their part, provide all technical details including consent necessary to file an application for obtaining rights on such IP . d. Once granted, the university will set aside funds for subsequent maintenance of patents or copyrights. e. However, in case where the university decides to not proceed with protection of IP , the member(s) may proceed to protect the IP by filing for patent or copyright registration at their own cost, and claim ownership to the IP . f. In such cases the university will seek the right for its members to use the IP for purpose of teaching and continued research at the university. 7. Academic recognition for generation of IP: a. The University will evolve a mechanism to grant academic recognition at the time of promotions and tenure decisions for contribution made by faculty members once a patent has been granted, or applied for, in India or abroad. b. It is to be understood that the said recognition will be greater in case the IP is licensed to, or transferred outright, to a third part for commercialization. 8. Grant of licensing IP for commercialization: a. The university will evolve processes, together with terms for one-time (or periodic) royalty payments, by which it grants license, or outright transfer, to a third party for commercialization of IP that it solely owns, or co-owns with a collaborator. b. In case of any IP it co-owns with a collaborator (or sponsor), the university will engage with the collaborator before granting license to a third party for commercialization of IP . c. In some cases the third party referred to may be the collaborator with which the university co-owns the IP .27 FACULTY POLICIES I MARCH 2018d. The university will be liberal in granting license to a start- up if one of the inventors of IP is a promoter of the start-up. e. Even in cases where IP is licensed or transferred to a third party, the university will seek to retain the right to use the IP for purpose of teaching and continued research at the university. f. The university will evolve a formula for sharing with inventors a part of the royalty payments it receives as a result of licensing the IP or for its outright transfer, which will form part of the consultancy policy document. 9. Monitoring and responding to infringement of IPR: a. In case of any IP the University owns, or co-owns with a collaborator, the university will evolve mechanisms to monitor infringement of IPR by another organization, and suitably respond to any infringement. Towards this the University will evolve a mechanism to monitor and respond suitably. b. In case of IP it co-owns with a collaborator: i. The university will monitor and respond in case a collaborator infringes on the university’s rights in violation of the IPR sharing agreement with the collaborator. ii. The university will make every effort to ensure that its own faculty and students do not infringe upon IP rights co-owned with collaborators, or IP that is solely owned by third parties. 10. Liability of the University for infringement of IPR: a. The University will not be liable or responsible in any manner for the violation of the IP rights by it faculty and students or collaborator in the event of any claim or criminal or civil action or suits or proceedings initiated by third parties for infringement of their IP rights.",7aa0b70a-9e85-4f73-8004-8640397b5b7a

Ideally, your webcam is pointed to a wall where there is little possibility of something happening in the background. If this is not possible, y ou can recreate this effect by hanging up a plain, thick white bedsheet. Limiting the space behind you will also help with the lighting auto-brightness. Find a comfortable seat and position You will be sitting for a long time, especially for multiple classes per day. It can be hard to concrete on teaching if you are uncomfortable. Get in a comfortable position first, and then set up the lighting, webcam and audio to accommodate you. Set up proper lighting Webcams can be remarkably unflattering, and a big part of appearing properly on camera is setting up the right lighting. Lighting from the back will darken your face. Lighting from only overhead lights tends to make you appear spectral. Inconsistent lighting, such as from a window, will cause the auto-brightness on your webcam to fluctuate. Soft, indirect lighting from the front, as depicted in the image on the right, works best. If lighting is a problem, ring-lights are relatively inexpensive and can go a long way in creating a better image. Adjust Webcam Height Having the webcam at an odd angle can distort how you can come across on video. Place the camera at eye level at eye level or slightly higher. Avoid angling the camera up from below your eye level. Place the camera far enough away that you can frame yourself in the middle of the image. If you were to split up the screen into thirds, your eyes should intersect with or be slightly below the line for the top third. See the figures below for an example. Figure 1 : Ideal lighting for a webcam session. Soft, indirect lighting from the front w orks best. Source: 5Setting Up Proper Acoustics Virtual meeting software like Google Meet and Zoom have integrated features that help eliminate background noise and eliminate volume levels. These features are not perfect, and you can do a lot to help the acoustics of your call. The microphone will pick up sounds in the background that can cause distortion in the feed. Eliminating this as much as possible will help keep the audio clear. Depending on your particular situation, having multiple auditory focal points will amplify some noises and reduce your own voice. The sound of a fan or air conditioner running can cause consistent background noise. Using headphones with an integrated microphone, can considerably improve the audio quality for you and your students. Figure 2 : The webcam should be at eye level or slightly higher. Source: Figure 3 : Your face should take up roughly the middle third of the frame.

Everyone should make sure that they have checked the video, microphone, and audio before joining the session. When possible, have a trial session with the technology before the first formal session. ●Be on time. Like an in-person meeting, showing up late can be distracting. Login to the meeting several minutes before it starts, in order to make sure you are there from the beginning. ●Please mute your microphone when you are not speaking. This keeps the background noise levels to a minimum, and helps every listener have a good experience. ➢Tip: To quickly mute your microphone use the keyboard shortcut: Google Meet  Zoom Windows Ctrl + d Alt + a Mac Cmd + d  Alt + a ●You are encouraged to keep your video turned on. It is hard for speakers to address someone they cannot see, and having a visual response from the audience makes speaking in a virtual meeting easier for everyone. If you are having bandwidth issues, turning off the video will help. ●Remote learning emulates a classroom as much as possible. This is best achieved when all participants are present, focused, and contribute as if they were in an in- class meeting. ●Please remember that the chat is a group chat. Whatever you type in there will be visible to the instructor, as well as everyone else in the meeting. Note that making comments not directly related to the course content is distracting to other students. Asking questions Each instructor will establish a protocol for asking questions. Some of these include: ●Raising your hand ● Using a “reaction” button in meeting ●Writing in the chat box Whatever the operational protocol, it is best for participants to wait until there is an acknowledgement by the instructor. Virtual meetings can be hard to follow when multiple people are speaking, and it is most efficient to contribute on a turn-based system. Other There is always a chance the technology fails or there is another issue with online instruction. Since time for the virtual meeting is very limited, it is best to address any issues outside of these hours 7Virtual Meeting Software In the summer of 2020, Ashoka decided to standardize its remote learning offerings. Currently, there is robust support for Google Classroom and its virtual meeting software Google Meet. For most use cases, Google Meet suits the requirements for a virtual class session. There are a limited number of Zoom licenses available to faculty who prefer to conduct their classes over Zoom. Faculty are encouraged to use these pieces of software because there will be a substantial institutional knowledge base regarding their feature set and useability. Attendance Attendance is both simple and challenging to manage in a virtual classroom. There is software available to automatically document attendance, but it is harder to determine who is actually physically present and paying attention during the session. It is a given that various technical problems could arise. The chrome extension “Meet Attendance” lets you take attendance during a live Google meet session. Closed Captioning and Transcription Google Meet allows any user in the session to turn on Closed Captioning for better intelligibility of the session. These captions are saved in the recording session, but not as a separate text file. If you would like to offer students the text transcript of the session this can be done through the Google Chrome extension: taqtic.io It is a good practice to save the transcript of your sessions for extra accessibility for students who were not able to attend the session. Recording Sessions Recording class sessions so they are available to students who were not able to attend is highly recommended. However, there may be scenarios where recording class sessions is not desirable. For example, if the course discusses personally sensitive topics recording it might stifle conversation. The default is that students assume they are being recorded. If the session is not being recorded it might be useful to let them know in advance. Recording Storage and Security In synchronous sessions, if you record your live lectures using Google Meet then they are available in the “Meeting folder” i n your Google drive. You can share these videos under the “classwork” tab in Classroom. Any textual, auditory or visual material in which students are identifiable may not be shared outside of the classroom without the express permission of the students depicted. Likewise, students may not distribute classroom recordings to any third parties. 9Making courses accessible for students with disabilities and English Language Learner issues benefits all students. In this respect, accessible course design offers a good set of design principles for course design more generally, and is often included under the larger umbrella of universal design for learning because it considers all possible users. Making course material accessible Planning for accessibility doesn’t automatically mean creating multiple versions or discarding activities, assignments, content up-front because it could be inaccessible for certain students. It means having thought through what you would do if a student for whom that activity was inaccessible registered for your class.2 The OLS recommends that the reading material be distributed in an accessible format such as Word or a Searchable PDF. Generally, accessible documents are first produced in Word, converted to PDF and then checked for accessibility . You may also refer to the more detailed presentation: Building Accessibility into Online Teaching and Learning . Making online lectures accessible Provide access to the lectures, synchronous or asynchronous, by using both the modalities –audio and visual. Invest in the technology that integrates both. Audio to Visual During lectures, the speech (audio) needs to be made available as a text to integrate the visual modality. Use technology tools that provide: ●Closed Captioning/ Subtitles ●Post-Production (recording) Transcription ●Live Transcription Google Meet has built-in Closed Captioning software. Tactiq.io creates free transcripts of these files and saves them in your Google Drive. ➢See: https://tactiq.io For free/paid Live Transcription in Zoom classes ➢See: Otter.ai Live Notes for Zoom Visual to Audio During lectures, the visuals, text and images, need to be made available as speech to integrate the audio modality. During the lecture, the text and images can be read aloud or explained and also shared with the students (with blindness) before class so that they can access them with their screen reader. Students with disabilities and English Language Learners have access to assistive technology resources on their own devices for the same. Contact Office of Learning Support at ols@ashoka.edu.in for further details. 2 https://canvas.ucdavis.edu/courses/34528/pages/accessibility- for-online-courses 10Teaching Modalities: Synchronous vs. Asynchronous Learning3 There are two options for instructors to facilitate class sessions remotely: ● Synchronous : instructors and students gather at the same time and interact in “real time” with a very short or “near -real time” exchange between instructors and students. ● Asynchronous: instructors prepare course materials for students in advance of students’ access. Students may access the course materials at a time of their choosing. Instructors may choose to engage their students synchronously or asynchronously depending on the course content or material that needs to be taught. There are distinct advantages and disadvantages to asynchronous and synchronous teaching options. Synchronous Teaching Asynchronous Teaching Advantages ❏Immediate personal engagement between students and instructors, which may create greate r feelings of community and reduce feelings of isolation. ❏More responsive exchanges between students and instructors, which may prevent miscommunication or misunderstanding.❏More scheduling flexibility, which may simultaneously make the learning experience s more accessible to different students. ❏Creates an archive of past materials that can be redeployed in future iterations of the course. ❏Students can control the pace of learning to a speed that is appropriate to them. Disadvanta ges ❏More challenging to schedule shared times for all students and instructors. ❏Some students may not be fully comfortable using the technology, or be disadvantaged by the limitations of their digital affordances.❏Students may feel less personally invested, and less satisfied wi thout the social interaction between their peers and instructors. ❏Course material may be misunderstood or have the potential to be misconstrued without the real -time interaction. 3 Teaching and Learning Center. “Faculty Resources for Remote Teaching and Learning.” Rider University.

Generally, smaller classes tend to lend themselves to synchronous activities, while larger classes might be more manageable with asynchro nous modalities. What constitutes a “small,” “medium,” or “large,” classroom is to some extent framed by the limits of the technology.4 The chart below provides a guide to possible activities based on classroom size. Though these will necessarily vary by discipline and specific course material. Type Participants User Experience Classroom Activity Small Participants < 25 Depending on device screen size and resolution, it is generally possible to see all participants in a Meet session simultaneously on one screen. Synchronous ❏Small breakout session with Zoom “rooms” ❏Guided discussion using Share Screen or shared document ❏Moderated chat discussion ❏Snap polls ❏Interactive Whiteboard Medium 25 < Participants < 50 It is not possible to see all participants simultaneously, or only with a dual monitor setup. Faculty will have to actively look at who may be participating in the class. Synchronous ❏Medium breakout sessions with Zoom “rooms” ❏Moderated chat discussion ❏Snap polls Asynchron ous ❏Pre-recorded materials by students ❏Short pre -recorded videos by the instructor Large 50 < Participants Google Meet allows for 250 participants and Zoom can handle 100, Synchronous ❏Snap polls ❏Interactive quizzes 4 The upper limits for the number of participants in Google Meet is 250 and Zoom is 100. 14but the ma jority will not be visible throughout the session. The current cap on the gallery size in Google Meet is 16. The Chrome extension Grid View , increases the number of visible participants to 100. Asynchronous ❏Pre-recorded lectures ❏Discussion board ❏Integrated quizzes ❏Annotated slides ❏Links to external sources Synchronous Pedagogies Overview Due to some of the technical limitations of online sessions, synchronous sessions tend to work best with smaller classes. With some modification, many of these pedagogies could equally well be applied to larger classes. Small Classrooms (Participants < 25) Small Breakout Sessions In Zoom it is possible to split the online class into “rooms.” Zoom has the option to do this automatically through randomization, or by manually allocating specific students into specific groups. Once c reated, it is possible for the instructor to “float” between rooms and check in on the discussion. This model allows faculty to check in with students on a more personal basis. ➢See: Zoom Managing Video Breakout Rooms . ➢Google Meet does not have this capability yet, but there are multiple plug- ins. One workaround can be found here , but it requires some planning and cannot be done “on the fly.” Guided discussion using Share Screen or shared document Provide readings for a class beforehand, assign one or two students as lead discussants for the paper/reading. The leads are meant to lead the discussion on the reading, possibly by preparing a minimal set of slides, if that works for the course/material. The instructor can then supplement the presentation at key points, and engage the rest of the class by asking pertinent questions. ➢See: Zoom Share Screen Google Meet Share Screen ➢ Moderated discussion using chat Not every student may be able to participate in a virtual classroom setting due to either technological or dispositional factors. In such cases, it is still possible for them to participate through the chat features of both Zoom and Google Meet. 15❏Possibility 1: Instructor posts question in the chat or shares it on the screen. Students respond to the question in their chat box, and this prompts further discussion. ❏Possibility 2: Instructor designates one student to moderate the discussion. Students who cannot actively participate in the video chat can still listen and respond and interact through the chat. ➢See: Zoom In-Meeting Chat   Google Meet In-Meeting Chat Discussion based on snap polls Snap polls are a quick way to gauge students’ surface -level understanding of a core concept. Ranging from true/false to multip le-choice, questions can be deployed directly during a Zoom session. A discrepancy in answers can solicit a point of clarification. ➢ See Pollings for Meetings Google Meet does not have native polling abilities, but there are various add-ons that achieve a similar effect. ➢See: Polls for Google Hangouts Chat Other options: ➢See: Poll Everywhere Polls Interactive Whiteboards Interactive whiteboards allow students to post into one collective space in real time. There are multiple ways of doing this, but the basic point is that students can brainstorm ideas and suggestions. Name Website Tool Cost Features Wakelet www.wakelet.com Allows students to share materials to a board in real time Basic is free Google Docs/Shee ts/Slides https://www.google.c om/docs/about/ Lets students collaborate in real time on a shared document Free Can see who does what on collaborative projects, never lose work (auto saves and can see ear lier drafts), can hyperlink all needed resources on one set of slides/document One of the challenges with interactive whiteboards is that the standard input device for a computer is a mouse or trackpad. These are very difficult to work with for any length of time. For more sustained usage of an interactive whiteboard there are a number of devices available. 16Recommended: ●WACOM One by CTL-672/K0-CX Medium 8.5-inch x 5.3-inch Graphic Tablet ●A stylus and pad input device that works with multiple pieces of software. Price around ₹8,000 ●IT is currently looking into requisitioning some devices for special cases. Please check to see if they are available. Other tablet devices that are compatible with a stylus also work, but these are more expensive and the setup is more involved. Working with Interactive Whiteboarding Google Meet Whiteboard support (Non-collaborative) 1.Use https://canvas.apps.chrome/ for whiteboard support. 2.Present the tab (where the Canvas is open) in the Google meet to students. Whiteboard Support (Collaborative) 1.Use https://jamboard.google.com/ for whiteboard support. 2.Present the tab (where the jamboard is open) in the Google meet to students. 3.Also create a shareable link of the Jamboard and paste it on the Chat window of Google meet 4.Both you and students can write and see the same Jamboard Working with Interactive Whiteboarding Zoom ➢See: Using annotation tools on a shared screen or whiteboard Setting up a Whiteboard session without a dedicated input device The instructor can join the Google/Zoom Meeting from two devices, simultaneously, say a laptop and a tablet. The latter has to (1) be capable of screen sharing, and (2) support a stylus (e.g. Apple Pencil) that allows the instructor to write on the tablet. The instructor can share the tablet’s screen, w hich doubles up as the whiteboard. The other device (laptop) can be used for sharing the instructor's video, and/or monitoring chat messages with student queries. Medium Classrooms (25 < Participants < 50) Medium breakout sessions Medium breakout sessio ns with Zoom “rooms”. Here the same principle as the “small” breakout session applies. The difference is that the groups might grow to become inordinately large. A possible solution is to deputize a more advanced student to lead the discussion, and report out upon the completion of the specified task. ➢See Zoom Managing Video Breakout Rooms . 17 Large Classrooms (50 < Participants) Lectures with Interactive Quizzes It is possible to create slideshows and other lecture materials that incorporate interactive quizzes. In some cases, these can be deployed live, in other modalities they can be used for pre-recorded material. The quizzes are a way to assess real-time understanding of the covered materials. In Google Meet quizzes can be deployed using Google Forms. The score on the quiz is automatically imported into the Classroom Gradebook. ➢Instructional video: Coming Soon Interactive quizzes can also be created with Camtasia. This process is substantially more involved and the grades will not export to Google Classroom automatically. The advantage is that the video and the quiz can be deployed in an asynchronous environment. Asynchronous Pedagogies Overview Not all learning needs to happen within the confines of the allotted meeting slots, and it may be more beneficial for the instructor and the student to re-think the structure of the course in a remote learning environment. These pedagogies are particularly useful when managing a large class. Medium Classrooms (25 < Participants < 50) Pre-recorded materials by students Students can “teach” a particular component of the class by preparing a video presentation in advance of the lecture. Given the constraints of synchronous online communication, this might be a good way to circumvent bandwidth requirements for large classes. There are several collaborative software options available for students to put together the video. The most straightforward way is to encourage students to schedule a Zoom or a Meet session and then record themselves. ➢See: Zoom  Meet Quicktime (Mac only) Large Classrooms (50 < Participants) Pre-Recorded Lectures For large classes, discussion may not be an option. There are several ways in which lectures can be pre- recorded and sent to students. It may not be necessary to create one lecture in its entirety, which can be both time consuming and not very engaging for students. Instead, breaking up long lectures into several shorter topic-based sections may be a more optimal option. 18If you are creating a pre-recorded lecture in a short time frame, consider a few simple tips.5 ❏Provide an explicit roadmap at the beginning. ❏Break down the lecture into shorter segments. A long pre-recorded lecture can be deadly boring to watch. ❏Intersperse the lecture clips with reflection questions for the students to consider. Try to make the learning experience “inductive” rather than entirely didactic. ❏Speak to the student, not to the camera. ❏Insert yourself – a personal story, humor, or editorial commentary – into the lecture. You don’t need to pre -record the entire lecture. Instead, you can pre-record certain segments of your lecture, such as material you want the students to reflect on before class, and leave the rest to the in-class session. Pre- recording and live needn’t be substitutes; they can serve as powerful complements too. Accessibility tips when recording videos:6 ❏Enable Closed Captioning in Google Meet for videos. ❏Keep recordings under 10 minutes. ❏Verbally describe any images or props you show in the video or include textual descriptions below the video. Adding Interactivity It is possible to integrate quizzes in a video lecture using Camtasia. This process is time consuming on the front end, but once created the video and questions can be reused in subsequent semesters. Another option is to upload lecture videos to YouTube and then embed those videos in a Google Quiz. Students watch part of the lecture, and subsequently answer questions. Although visually clunkier, this has the added advantage of directly exporting the quiz score to Google Classroom. ➢See: Creating interactive quizzes with Google Forms Suggested Tools: ➢See: Camtasia  How to Record your Lecture with PowerPoint in Zoom   Google Meet 5 “Best Practices: Online Pedagogy,” accessed April 4, 2020, https://teachremotely.harvard.edu/best- practices . 6 Cornell Resource Library. “Getting Started with Panopto.” Cornell University, accessed: 03/04/2020. URL: https://canvas.cornell.edu/courses/1848/pages/getting- started- in-panopto 19Discussion Board7 To remove technical hurdles and to ensure that students are able to engage with peers and each other in a discussion-based class, you might choose to move student discussion to an asynchronous format. Create a discussion forum to facilitate communication, encourage students to interact, ask questions and respond to discussion prompts. Pedagogical recommendations: ➢Craft discussion questions to be as clear and as specific as possible so that students can build off of the question for a sustained response. ○See Stanford TeachingCommons’ “Designing Effective Discussion Questions” ○See “Conversation Starters: Orchestrating Asynchronous Discussion to Build Academic Community among First- Year Writers” by Dan Seward ➢Assign roles to students so that they understand when and how they might respond to you or their peers. For example, students might “role play” as particular kinds of respondents or you might ask them to do particular tasks (e.g. be a summarizer, a respondent, a connector with outside resources). Google Classroom will allow you to create discussion questions for students, and moderate the discussion in various ways. Responses to the discussion questions can also be graded and automatically recorded in Classroom’s gradebook. ➢See: Create a discussion question in Google Classroom Annotated Slides Pre-recording lectures can be very labor intensive. To simplify matters, one can also send the slide deck w ith notes. This “low -tech” solution is actually beneficial to students who have bandwidth issues and cannot watch the lectures in real-time or as a recording. For some students this is actually an easier way to learn than listening. Links to external sources Although never a replacement for your own teaching, there is a wealth of learning material available online. Some core concepts in your discipline may have been covered by other educators. It does not always make sense to reinvent the wheel, especially when faced with a time crunch. ➢See: Jove ibiology 7 Cohn, Jenae and Beth Seltzer, “Teaching Effectively During Times of Disruption,” Google Docs, accessed April 5, 2020, https://docs.google.com/document/d/1ccsudB2vwZ_GJYoKlFzGbtnmftGcXwCIwxzf- jkkoCU/preview?usp=embed_facebook . 20Overview: Low Stakes and High Stakes Assignments In Engaging Ideas , John Bean broadly defines two types of assessment in the classroom: low-stakes and high-stakes.8 Low-stakes are weighted lower percentage-wise, but are more frequent and informal, high-stakes assignments are weighted higher but more infrequent. Both types of assignments are valuable measures of student engagement and learning. In a remote setting, there may be a need for more frequent “low -stakes” assignments to encourage student engagement. Meanwhile, “high -stakes” assignments are a valuable way to assess student mastery of content, but, given the online setting, are more susceptible to academic dishonesty. Low Stakes Assignments Entry Slips/Exit Slips Before the start of class students come up with a critical question about the material they were meant to prepare for that day. At the end of the session they make clear what they learned and how they would answer the question they posed. A very simple grading scheme of check+, check, check-, or 3, 2, 1 can make grading these relatively quick, while at the same time gauging student participation. Automated Quizzes This could be done through mechanisms like the Quiz feature of Google Classrooms. The instructors can prepare quizzes based on the material covered every week. There are a range of possible quiz question types, including: short answer, long answer, multiple choice, multiple select, and more complex question types. High Stakes Assignments Exams Generally proctoring exams in an online environment is very challenging. The level of student surveillance required to make sure there is no academic dishonesty during synchronous exams, also enhances the chances of technical problems for students. Even with a high level of surveillance, it is not possible to guarantee that students will not engage in academic dishonesty. If there is no other way to do the assessment for a course special arrangements can be made with IT for online synchronous proctoring. Modified Take Home Exams Depending on the course being offered, instructors can decide to offer take home exams, which could be “open book” and “open internet.” The idea is to create a set of questions that help students provide logical arguments, or design choices for the possibly open- ended set of questions being posed to them. The exam can be posted on Google Classroom and made available at a specific date and time. The various question types available in the 8 Bean, John C. Engaging Ideas: The Professor's Guide to Integrating Writing, Critical Thinking, and Active Learning in the Classroom . The Jossey-Bass Higher and Adult Education Series. 2nd ed. San Francisco: Jossey- Bass, 2011. 22Google Classroom Quiz feature, should be able to cover most exam types. Otherwise, students can also submit a file as their response. Take Home Exams and Academic Dishonesty The possibility of illicit or collaborative exploitation of intellectual resources is particularly high with regard to take-home exams. There is no way to guarantee that a student does not consult unsanctioned resources. There are several ways to mitigate the possibility or make it less desirable: Fixed time window: Deploying and receiving the exam in a specific window of time prevents the possibility of collaboration and other forms of academic dishonesty. Google Classroom will allow you to regulate when the exam is posted and lock when the exam can be received. Note that students have expressed that this method can be quite stressful, because if there is a power outage or another technical issue it could prevent them from turning in the exam on time. Similarity check: Google Classroom now has an integrated similarity check that can be used for exams. Alternatively, exams can be passed through Turnitin to check whether students directly copied answers. ➢See: Best Practices for Online Exam Design - Pepperdine University 23Unlike theory-based courses, practical courses are generally of longer durations and require specialized infrastructure support. In addition to this, moving practical courses online results in students taking more time to become familiar with the learning material, internalize how(s) and why(s) of each step in the practical and critically analyse the concepts presented. Their peer-learning ecosystem is also disrupted. Therefore online teaching/learning of such courses may not provide the desired result and learning experience. However, some of the suggestions below may be helpful, to a certain extent, in learning the subject matter and building relevant and useful skill(s)-set : 1.Re-organizing of the order of courses between monsoon and spring semester. ➢Lab courses scheduled in monsoon 2020 may be shifted (postponed) to spring 2021, and replacement theory based courses scheduled in spring 2021 may be brought forward to be taught in the monsoon 2020 semester. 2.In case reorganization of courses as mentioned in #1 (above) is not possible, the course coordinators may consider, a.Re-evaluate learning objectives and outcomes by re-designing the course curriculum to incorporate in-silico experiments/demonstrations and/or analysis of data obtained from these experiments/demonstrations.. b.Livestream / Recorded demonstrations of the laboratory experiments The course coordinators and/or instructional support staff may demonstrate the experiments in the lab and choose to stream the experiment demonstration live (synchronous) or record pictures/ videos of different parts of the experiments (asynchronous). The gathered data could be shared with the students to analyse and make observations. If possible, the students may be allowed to perform these experiments upon their return to the campus. c.Virtual Labs There are a number of ways (listed below) that allow students to approximate laboratory experience through active participation rather than passive observation, virtually. Most of the virtual labs listed in the link below are extremely discipline specific and there is a significant range in quality, but might offer a temporary stopgap, until the students return to the campus: https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/18iVSIeOqKjj58xcR8dYJS5r YvzZ4X1UGLWhl3brRzCM/htmlview 25Office Hours Meeting students outside of class hours can be a challenge. Although it is possible to schedule a running Google Meet for office hours and propagate it in the course calendar, there is no way to anticipate who will show up, or to establish a queue for students. One efficient way to schedule office hours is through the scheduling software Calendly . You can create meeting slots for your students who can then sign up. If a student signs up, it will place that meeting on your Google calendar, and block the slot for other students. You can also change your availability on the calendar, so you never need to inform students of when your office hours are, just give them the link. ➢See: Connect Calendly to Zoom 27Academic Integrity The remote learning environment brings with it a different set of challenges with regard to academic integrity. Fortunately, many of the core principles that help prevent academic dishonesty in an in-person classroom also apply to a virtual classroom. In general, it is better to prevent academic dishonesty through assignment design and deployment than through punitive means after the fact.9 1.Ask open-ended critical questions that require unique answers. 2.Scaffold large assignments into smaller parts that help you track student progress , and reduce the chance of plagiarism. 3.Students are more likely to commit academic dishonesty on a singular high-stakes assignment than several low-stakes assignments cumulatively worth the same weight. Spreading assignments out over the course of the semester can lower student anxiety, and reduce the need to resort to getting non-sanctioned support for an assignment. 4.Academic dishonesty is not the same in every course or even for every assignment. Be explicit as to what resources students can use to complete their assignment. May they consult old exams? Work with fellow students on a paper? Work with material they wrote for a previous class? Clarifying what constitutes academic dishonesty for a specific assignment can prevent misunderstandings. 5.Students are less likely to cheat when the scope and requirements for an assignment are clear. 6.Explicitly stating that you use plagiarism prevention software, and demonstrating the software can act as a strong deterrent. 7.Reminding students of the Academic Integrity policy and the consequences of committing a violation has been shown to reduce cheating. 8.Allowing students to signal in their paper when they are uncertain about how to use a source can create a productive learning moment. 9 Some of the language here has been adapted from the site on Remote Learning and Academic Integrity created by the Library and Technology services department at Lehigh University. “Remote Learning and Academic Integrity | Library & Technology Services.” Accessed August 4, 2020. https://lts.lehigh.edu/remote-learning-and-academic-integrity . 29Student Recommendations The recommendations below have been collated by the student representatives from all departments. They offer an overview of the most pressing concerns for students, and practices they have found successfully address those concerns. Attendance Policy for Synchronous Learning Issues: (i) Students might have varied household conditions, and may not be able to adhere to attendance requirements. (ii) Technical issues can also be an obstacle for class attendance. (iii) International students might not be able to join synchronous classes. Solution: (i) Owing to difficult circumstances, students found it really helpful when professors clearly delineated what constituted an excused and an unexcused absence, and the number allowed for each course. (ii) One particularly productive way in which one professor dealt with students not being able to attend synchronous sessions was by creating optional assignments that counted towards attendance. High Stakes and Low Stakes Assignments Issues: (i) It is more difficult to properly schedule time for doing assignments at home. Both because students may have household commitments to attend to, and because they may get too much screen time in one day. Scheduling becomes even more challenging when high stakes and low stakes assignments are not properly defined at the beginning of the semester. (ii) For courses following a Midterm-Final paper/exam format, the lack of low-stakes assignments adds more pressure on students who may not be able to perform evenly on exams/final papers due to personal or technical reasons. (iii) It becomes challenging for students to complete high-stakes assignments without access to the required resources, such as books, scholarly articles, and other research materials. (iv) Since almost all of the course content is now digital, it has become more difficult for students to keep up with the readings due to screen fatigue. Solution: (i) Students are better able to organize their time when the high and low stake assignments are clearly defined at the start of the semester for every course. (ii) For courses following a Midterm-Final paper/exam format, more low-stakes assignments provide more opportunities for students to properly showcase their knowledge than a high pressure situation like an exam of final paper. (iii) All resources for high-stakes assignments should be provided beforehand, for example, in a shared google drive folder for the class. For assignments where this is not 31possible, grading curves should be cognizant of any uneven resource distribution among students. (iv) Students found it more effective to do several short readings, as opposed to one very long reading that causes screen fatigue. Procedure for Remote Examinations Issues: (i) Households do not provide the same composed and undisturbed setup as classrooms in terms of taking examinations, leading to an inability to focus. (ii) Unexpected technical issues or power cuts might further hinder exam performance and submission. Solution: (i) An example that worked really well for students was allotting extra time for remote exams in anticipation of technical difficulties and/or interruptions in the test taker’s location. (ii) Students found it really beneficial when there were multiple quizzes/exams, and only the best scores were taken into consideration to provide more buffer for students who may underperform due to technical or circumstantial issues. Assessing Class Participation for Synchronous and Asynchronous Classes. Issues: (i) Remote learning makes it difficult for students to participate in all class activities. (ii) Larger class sizes and technical difficulties also impact class participation. Solution: (i) An example that really worked for students was when the professor assessed class participation only on the basis of the quality of participation shown in the classes the student was able to partake in. (ii) Students found that weekly discussion posts on online platforms (such as Canvas and Piazza) were able to engage with the class better when they were the primary criteria to grade them for class participation. Recorded Lectures for Asynchronous Classes Issues: (i) In an asynchronous setting, students might find it difficult to continuously engage in recorded lectures. (ii) A lack of student-teacher interaction might further disengage students from the recorded lecture format and hinder the Q/A or feedback process. Solution: (i) Students found it easiest to follow lectures that were broken down into smaller sections and that covered discrete topics. 32(ii) Some of the best lectures were those where the instructor's face was visible, because it was easier to engage with the material. (iii) Students felt more engaged and involved when instructors occasionally held synchronous meetings to discuss the lecture material with students. (iv) Students found one- on-one short feedback sessions conducted by instructors to be the most effective for clearing queries and concerns about the course or materials. 33",460439c7-c4c5-4ab7-a663-6e073952a7c9

Guidelines for Considering Requests for the Repatriation of Items from the University Collections   2 1. Introduction  Objectives and Scope * This document outlin es the broad principles followed by Ashoka University Library for building and managing a rich, diverse and relevant collection of library resources to promote and support teaching, learning and research in the University and, ide ally, in the wider academic and learning community. The policy tries to keep in view the evolving dynamics between teaching and research, and the acquisition, management and preservation of library resources in the interest of s timulating and facilitating the production of knowledge and its dissemination.  Manuscripts in various media (paper, palmyra, ba rk, parchment , cloth ), print, microforms (microprint, microfilm and microfiche) and electronic resources (e -journals, databases, websites, and born-digital material) are all important for research and teaching, although currently and in the foreseeable future print and e -texts are likely to be the dominant formats. The aim of the policy is to develop and co-ordinate these resources, optimize funds available, and ensure secure and cost - efficient access to machine -readable formats. In th e latter, the stress would necessarily be on access rather than ownership rights to the copy. Rationalization of stock needs to be taken into account if future growth (estimated to be over at least 500 metres per annum) is to be provided for. This is not counting variables such as inflation, fluctuations in exchange -rate, availability of funds and changes in curricula and courses. Principles of transfer, disposal and relegation of existing stock have to be addressed in the Collection Management policy. In addition, a shift to e -preference, especially in the case of journals, may be necessary as increasing stocks claim shelf -space.  All collections in the University Library system, including those in libraries of Departments, Schools, Centres, Museums, Galle ries, Special Programmes, Heritage Collections, Archives, ** Donations and acquisitions under special Research Projects would be co vered by the Library Collections Policy. Interpretation , application and review rest with the relevant custodians, such as the Library Committee, the administrators of the Ashoka Archives of Contemporary India, and a Research Committee for a funded project.  *The Library Collections Policy is in two parts : the Collection Development (Chapter 3) and Collection Management (Chapter s 4 and 5 ). Chapter 3 should be read in conjunction with Chapter s 4 and 5 and vice versa . These need to be co-ordinated with Library Rules, relevant Reports , Library Committee Resolutions, relevant decisions of Ashoka Archives of Contemporary India, and the Financial Regulations of the University .  **The document is supplemented by the Archival Policy of the University which is of especial relevance to the Ashoka Archives of Contemporary India.  1.1 Library Mission and Vision Statements  The Library Collections Policy is formulated keeping in view the overall Mission of Ashoka University and its Vision Statement.  The Statements are: 1.1.1 Mission Statement 3  Ashoka University Library promotes the production and dissemination of knowledge through  the collection and creation of a wide range of resources for learning, teaching and research  making such resources available to students, researchers and teachers it serves and to th e wider scholarly community  preserving collections and ensuring their coordinated management  offering research support  delivering quality and effective service for their application in the form most relevant to users.  1.1.2 Vision Statement  Ashoka University Library aims to build a rich collection ranging over manuscripts, printed books and periodicals, ephemera, microforms, maps, graphic reproductions, teaching tools and machine - readable texts including e -journals and databases. The collection wil l constitute one of the leading resources for learning and research in the country and it aspires to eventually match the best international standards for academic libraries.

Directive Principles for the Collections Policy  1. The access to General Collections should be open to browsing and located where they can best be used.  2. Special Collections and Rare Books , especially Heritage Collections, acquired outside the narrow limits of disciplinary requirements for research and learning, are for study in the lib rary and the stacks are not open for free browsing . It is preferable that such Collections are purchased using endowments and through external fund -raising, or acquired through donations and bequests. The acquisitions should not be random, but should be in accordance with current collections, disciplinary demands and priorities of research and teaching. In rare cases, personal libraries and valuable books and documents may be purchased at auctions or online. However, these need to be vetted by competent aut horities on a case -by-case basis. Authorized and approved agents may conduct transactions in cases to save on cost of travel by faculty and library staff.  3. The Library collects and preserves its significant institutional records and the research output of faculty and students in manuscript, print and electronic formats in its Institutional Repository.  4. Journals are best acquired using an e -preference model wherever possible. A Perpetual Access mode should be adopted wherever feasible after negotiatin g prices, since the Annual Subscription mode is unstable and expensive.  5. Gifts, transfers and relegation of books, manuscripts and archives will be determined using criteria listed in the Collection Management Policy. Criteria may have to be applied be fore consenting to accepting gifts and bequests (see 3.7 below).  6. Unsolicited Deposits will only be accepted in circumstances listed in 3.7. 7. Duplicate and multiple copies of a print title are best discarded or not acquired, unless the text is being used in current or continuing courses and is needed by students.  8. Transfer, relegation and disposal of items in stock, subject to criteria st ated in the Collection Management Policy, will aim at achieving a balance between accession and disposal of material needed to make room for new material.  9. The print copies of electronic resources which provide Perpetual A ccess of journals will be asses sed by the competent authority for relegation to the Dormitory or S tore.  10. The implications of agreements with other libraries and aggregators concerning access, and of inter-library loans may be considered while decisions are made on the acquisition a nd retention of material.  7  Part 1  3. Collection Development  3.1 Funding The Budget for the Library sanctioned by the University is the primary source of funds for the purchase of material. Additional sources may include ext ernal fund -raising, special one-time grants, endowment incomes and donation s. Optimizing of resources will take into account the strengths and weaknesses in th e University’s collections, its prio rities in research and teaching, and acquisitions which have the potential of generating revenue.  3.2 Collaborations Agreements and collaborations with other universities in India and abroad may include Collection Development in focus areas.  3.2.1 Collaborations may be further strengthened by contracts with academic foundations and aggregat ors.  3.2.2 Items 3.2 and 3.2.1 may again be supplemented by alliances with consortia and library networks and with individual research institutions as and when these are form ed and put into effect.  3.3 General Collections (Open Access) The Library aims to acquire materials for teaching all undergraduate and postgraduate courses in appropriate and available formats. The Library focuses on the acquisition of materials , in Indian and foreign languages, for disciplines currently studied —the humanities, the social sciences and the basic mathematical and natural sciences. Resources for specialized research will follow faculty and student requirements. Sharing of resources with other libraries in possessio n of expensive material will be preferred in order to optimize the use of funds. In addition to Departments, staff and faculty, students are encouraged to specify needs. Materials purchased for projects and special courses, unless explicitly specified in t he terms of the grant , will become the property of the University Library. Although physically decen tralized, all acquired stock will be centrally accessioned and processed.  3.3.1 The University may purchase material for General Collections from publish ers, publishers’ agents, enlisted vendors, or online vendors. In all cases, the Library will, through the purchasing mechanism authorized by the University, compare prices, look for available discounts on net market price, and demand price -proofs from supp liers. Valuable print editions of important books and multi -volume sets of reference books, estima ted to have a long shelf -life, are best procured as hardback copies . 3.3.2 The Uni versity Library prefers acquiring electronic resources in the P erpetual Access mode. However, when this is not feasible, the provider may permit licensed access for the tenure of the contract. The Library will make use of consortial alliances and partnership s wherever possible to acquire materials, and negotiate with suppliers fo r the lowest rates admissible. 8 3.3.3 The general view of the University is that users should not be permitted unlicensed and unauthorized access to electronic material. Nor should the Library encourage the unauthorized use of material in copyright or of pirated texts (including images) in any format. This general view is subject to the University Policy on Copyright.  3.3.4 The Library allocates a n amount in its budget to reference guides, subjects in the Minor curricula, and interdisciplinary studies. These would also in clude dictionaries and encyclop edias in English and other Indian languages, bibliographies, biographical dictionaries, atlases, online databases of scholarly reference materials, and reference guides in print and, wherever available, in electronic and other machine -readable formats. These materials need not necessararily be recommended by Departments. Recommendations may come from members of the faculty, members of the Library Committee, members of the Library staff, researchers and students.  3.4 Electronic Resources 3.4.1 Journals , wherever possible and when funds permi t, will be acquired in the e -format. The Library will review the renewal of licence agreement s, and assess value for money, data analysis, relevance, licence terms for multiple use, possibilities of duplication in other packages purchased , future problems in Collection Management, and sustainability of the purchasing model. However, when funds are scarce , the Library will ensure that no researcher, student or faculty is underserved, making alternative arrangements , such as inter -library loans , whenever nec essary.  3.4.2 E-preference will guide acquisitions of current journals, archives of back issues (such as JSTOR), full-text databases (such as the Early English Books Online or EEBO ), abstracting and indexing tools.  3.4.3 E-books are an option especially in the case of languages in which printed texts are not easily available in India.  3.5 Materials for Users with Special Needs Texts in braille, audio books, vector images and electronic tools (such as voice -text synthesizing software) are recommended, as necessary, for purchase to serve users with special needs  3.6 Special Collections  Special Collections, especially Rare Books and collections of heritage value (on occasions collectively referred to as Heritage Collections in this docume nt), seek to augment holdings in addition to materials purchased to meet subject requirements for research and learning. It also seeks to build Collections that would supplement the Ashoka Archives of Contemporary India which touches upon virtually all asp ects of the intellectual and cultural life of India’s present and recent past.  3.6.1 The Library aims to acquire rare printed books; manuscripts in different materials such as paper, parchment, bark , cloth and palmyra; printed proofs; images; letters; photographs as prints, negatives and slides; drawings and graphic prints; maps; archives (including publishers’ archives) ; and unpublished material s such as official records and personal diaries through gifts, bequests, purchase, deposit and transfer. 9 3.6.2 In particularly relevant cases, to be decided on a case -by-case basis by the Library Committee or any other com petent authority appointed for the purpose, these may be purchased at auctions keeping in view the cost and benefit (including intangible on es) involved.  3.6.3 All special items will be assessed, keeping in view the disciplinary interests and strengths of the University Collections , principal areas of c ollections, the gaps in its holdings . The objective is to serve the international community of scholars, while according priority to the need of the facul ty, researchers and students at the University.  3.6.4 Gifts, Deposits and Transfers pertaining to any Special Collection will be subject t o Deed of Gift, Deposit A greements and internal transfer procedures stated in the Collection Management Policy . Periodic reviews of these Collections will aim to assess use, cost of maintenance and sustainability.  3.7 Gifts Donations and bequests of book s, journals and documents in any of the usual formats acquired by the Library are welcome, especially of materials relating to curricula and courses , and of valuable archival materials to the custody of Ashoka Archives of Contemporary India.  3.7.1 Donors are invited to send lists of items, including formats, titles, authors (if any), dates of publication, and a brief description of their physical condition (e.g. brittle, hardback with spine partially damaged, etc .) to be gifted to the University. In certa in cases, where the number of items is unusually large, the University may help donors with the listing, especially if the donor is unable to do so because of reasons such as poor health. Help may be offered in the form of secretarial assistance or financi al compensation for hiring assistants. But such instances should be exceptional, and such gifts should be esteemed to be rare and valuable.  3.7.2 The acceptance of gifts is at the University’s discretion, and the Library Committee may seek the expertise of members of the faculty for selecting offered items. Accepted gifts become the property of the University and, as owner, the University reserves the right of retention, location, processing, remova l and other relevant aspects stated in the Collection Man agement Policy. However, Ashoka Arc hives of Contemporary India may serve as custodians of materials gifted on a permanent basis. The ownership of the materials gifted to the Ashoka Archives may be retained by donors . 3.7.2 should be read in conjunction with the Archival Policy of the University.   3.7.3 Duplicate copies of items owned by the Library are not accepted except when additional copies of a text are needed for teaching . Another exception to the rule is in the case of items of a named collection or archive which is to be accepted in its entirety . A similar exception may be made when a duplicate copy is valued for copy-specific reasons such as information on provenance, publishers’ notices in the oddments, authorial inscriptions and period marginalia. Materials available elsewhere such as duplicate typescripts, facsimiles, photocopies and off -prints are usually unaccepted unless there are compelling reasons to do so (e.g. such as a duplicate typescript showing marks of censor’s deletions) . In all such instances, the experts authorized by the University will arrive at the final decision.  3.7.4 The legal implications of the terms and conditions under which a prospective donor is willing to make a gift (such as a special name for the c ollection, location and display for a donated archive, 10 display of brand name for corporate donations, restrictions put on access etc .) will be considered when deciding on acquisition or retention.  3.7.5 The University Library welcomes supplementary donations made toward processing and retention of the gif ted material.  3.7.6 All donations toward the Library infrastructure are ack nowledged in ways agreed to by the donor and the University.  3.8 Unsolicited Deposits The Library may take on deposit unsolicited items for a mutually agreed period , if the materials are deemed of value for research and teaching. Their long -term status will be determined through an expert review by the University Library.  3.8.1 Depositor s are liable to be charged a fee for processing, storage, security and maintenance for the agreed period. The fee will be determined in accordance with the physical condition and size of the deposit.  3.8.2 Should the depositor wish to sell the materials an d should the University Library agree to acquire the materials permanently, the University Library will reserve first right of refusal, and will expect to be offered the materials at a discounted price estimated on the deemed market valu e. 3.9 Digitization and Microfi lming The University aims , in the long run, to digitize select primary materials such as those items in the Ashoka Archives of Contemporary India and other items in the Rare Books Section and the Special Collections. This would help in restricting access to the physical, occasional brittle, documents, and yet enable access.  3.9.1 For documents digitized or microfilmed, a ccess will be provided through files in PDF, while TIFF versions would be retained for storage. Scholars who need to examine the physical objects need to furnish reasons for seeking access to the physical documents. Such requests, if and when the concerned documents are digitized, will be considered by members of the faculty engaged by the Library Committee because o f their expertise in the related field. Until such time, h owever, the original physical copies may be consulted at the discretion of the authorities in charge of the Library and the Archives, and displayed at exhibitions and library -related events after en suring appropriate security. The clauses in 3.9 related to the Ashoka Archives of Contemporary India are to be read in conjunction with the Archival Policy of the University .  3.9.2 In the absence of in -house capacity, digitization is to be done by experienced service -providers who meet the technical and financial requirements specified by the University in its invitation for bids. In exceptional circumstances, the Board and leadershi p might recommend a service -provider over the lowest bidder because of their proven record of excellence or the sensitive nature of the documents to be digitized.  3.9.3 Identifying items to be digitized will be guided by research needs, the heritage statu s of the items, teaching requirement s, significance to the wider community of scholars and citizens, urgency relating to conservation and restoration, prospect of generating income for the Li brary and the potential to encourage units or users to partially fund the costs. The Library Committee will establish a decision -making mechanism for selecting items for digitization. 11  3.9.4 Digitization enhances access, but preservation is achieved through microfilms. If and when the University Library identifies mater ials for microfilming following procedures similar t o those for selecting materials to be digitized, service providers would be engaged following principles and procedures adopted in the case of outsourcing the work of digitization.  3.9.5 Microforms acquired by the Library through microfilming its collections or through gifts must be stored in a dedicated Section or in a n equipped place s ecured against fire.  3.9.6 Microfilms will be read in the library using microfilm readers. Prints of microfilmed materials may be allowed at the discretion of the Library Management . The latter may charge a specified fee for the service.  12 Part 2 4. Collection Management  Within the terms of this Policy and other aspects such as Collection Development, Ashoka Universi ty Library will follow a policy of non -discrimination, that is, it will not exclude materials, dispose of them, or restrict access to them on the basis of the race, nationality, religion, ethnic or linguistic identity, gender, sexual preference, doctrinal or sectarian considerations of either their producers or their users. Acquiring an item, or providing access to it, does not imply that the University endorses any statement or opinion contained in it.  The Collection Management Policy is designed to be r ead with the Collection Development Policy, and is part of the Collections Policy of the University Library. It is aimed at the effective management, in all its aspects, of collections in all formats and of all types. The aspects include cataloguing and classification ; rationalizing of physical stock; storage and movement of stock; transfer, relegation and disposal; preservation; budgetary management; security; and user -access.  4.1 Cataloguing and Classification  4.1.1 Cataloguing and classification follow the Dewey Decimal System and are individually recorded in an online catalogue.  4.1.2 Archival and manuscript materials follow requirements of collection -level records in degrees of detail as required by the material.  4.1.3 The catalogue including the OPAC will fol low MARC 21 standards.  4.1.4 It is recommended that the metadata of digitized material created follow Dublin Core standards in order to conform to the protocols demanded in international collaborations and exchange.  4.1.5 General Collections are put on Open A ccess and arranged according to the classification system adopted.  4.1.6 Manual records, if any, are retro -converted for the online catalogue.  4.1.7 Electronic resources follow the principles applied to physical stock, ideally with a link t o the source. The principles will be , when necessary, adapted to the requirements of terms and conditions of acquisition.  4.2 Rationalization of Stock  4.2.1 Duplicate and multiple copies of a material will be acquired, accepted as gifts and retained only in instances stated in 3.7.3 .  4.2.2 Printed duplicate or multiple titles of books and journals are liable to be assessed for relegation and disposal. 13 4.2.3 Duplication of electronic titles will also be avoided . The general principle will be part of the process of acquisition and evaluation of e -resources.  4.2.3 Members of the faculty will be encouraged to propose a reasonable ratio of multiple copies per student of material required for courses taught.  4.2.4 Print copies of electronic journals whi ch provide guaranteed access in the long -term to electronic back -files will be assessed for relegation to S tore. Following the relegation period, titles may be transferred or disposed in accordance with principles stated in 4.7.  4.3 Storage and Movement of Stock  4.3.1 In the interest of maximizing shelving space, enhancing security and facilitating Open Access, the Library will examine whether identified duplicate and multiple copies or low -use materials should be relegated to the Store.  4.3.2 The Stor e will be Closed Access and may employ mobile shelving with flexible gangway width.  4.3.3 The Library will arrange a delivery service to and from the Store following procedures of document delivery or inter -library loans.  4.4 Transfer, Relegation and D isposal  a) Transfer is the relocation from one library to another or one collection to another (for example, from the Main Library to a Special Collections). b) Relegation is the relocation to a Store. c) Disposal is the removal of the physical item by discard, gift or sale.  4.4.1 Usage statistics will be a factor in the transfer, relegation and disposal of some categories of material (such as text -books that were set for discontinued courses). But it will not be the sole determining factor, or even the dominant factor, given that a University Library has to keep in view the needs of scholars in the future and the requirements of those who study and research minority specialisms.  4.4.2 Special Collections , Rare B ooks and heritage acquisitions will be treated as exceptions to the general principle of 4.4.1.  4.4.3 In cases where the general principles do not apply, the issue will be referred to the Library Committee to be decided on a case -by-case basis.  4.4.4 The Library staff concerned will decide on transfer, relegation and disposal in consultation with subject experts from members of the faculty.  4.4.5 Transfer, relegation and disposal will be advertised in advance for users on the Library website.  4.4.6 Criteria for Transfer 14 The following categories of materials may be assessed for transfer to Special Collections and Rare Books Section as is deemed fit in each case : a) all print material pre -dating 1800 b) materials published prior to 1867, the year the Indian Press and Registration of Books Act was first passed c) materials pre -dating 1914, the year the Indian Copyright Act was passed d) materials containing book plates, colour illustrations, maps, diagrams, photographs e) manuscripts f) photographic prints from origin al negatives g) items with evidence of important ownership, inscriptions, censors’ deletions and stamps, significant marginalia, and record of provenance h) limited editions (limited to 150 copies or fewer) i) private press publications j) fragile and valuable items k) items in rare (for Indian c ollections) languages and characters l) prints or manuscript on rare materials (e.g. parchment, palm leaf, bark, cloth, paper made from cotton) m) wood cuts and xylographs n) books with ornamental or period binding o) any item associated wi th the University or its institutional history p) copies autographed by the author or gifted to an eminent recipient by the author  4.4.7 Criteria for Relegation  The following categories of material may be considered for relegation to store:  a) books, journals and documents with demonstrably negligible user -interest b) superseded editions of standard text -books c) material in subjects and specialisms not currently taught or researched at the University d) hard copies of books accessible in electronic fo rmat e) material to be retained under collaborative agreements or contractual obligations f) criteria 4.4.7 (a), 9b), (c), (d), and (e) are subject to conditions stated in 4.4.1  4.4.8 Criteria for Disposal  The following c ategories of material may be considered for disposal:  a) University records that do not fulfil the criteria of the Collection Development Policy as extended to the Institutional Repository and Ashoka Archives of Contemporary India b) irreparably damaged material, especially those likely to contaminate proximate material on shelves and cabinets c) duplicate or multiple copies and superseded editions of text -books not requisitioned from the Store for over 5 years d) duplicate or multiple copies of printed books of demonstrably negligible value e) duplicate or multiple sets of low -use journals f) duplicates of items held in the Store 15 g) duplicates of low -use print material available as reliable texts in machine -readable format h) low-use m aterial readily available from the S tore or through inter -library lo an or document delivery i) print material, including abstracts and indexes, held in a more convenient format j) material to which the Library has secure access from a trusted electronic archival source k) outdated reference sources, except for items of historical r esearch value l) outdated reference sources taking up shelf -space in Open Source General Collections m) imperfect copies in which the imperfections have neither demonstrable nor likely bibliographical significance n) items the possession of which has been declared a punishable offence under the law  4.5 Preservation and Conservation Preservation is aimed at complementing the work of acquisition and making available recorded knowledge considered valuable. It indicates the goal of the Library in its strategy for ret ention, especially its Special Collections.  Conservation refers to professional care taken by the Library through the application of technical means to enhance the longevity of material and, especially, to protect collections of archival and heritage val ue.  Unless especially required by the context, both will be covered by the word ‘Preservation’ in Section 4.5. 4.5.1 Preservation entails the environment in which Collections are stored and used; procedures of handling; treatment of materials in the process of binding, repair and conservation; guidelines related to displays and exhibitions; security measures (see 4.7) and the training of staff and users.  4.5.2 The Library Official designated the Chief Executive has overall responsibility for the care of the collections, including their preservation. Conservation staff are responsible to the Director of Library Services / Chief Librarian.  4.5.3 Official s and members of the staff may be assigned special responsibilities in the Library and Ashoka Archives of Contemporary India by object types —material on paper, printed books, photographic prints and plates, audio recordi ngs.  4.5.4 Preservation will prioritize areas considered the strengths in the Library’s collections and in the teaching and research at the University.  4.5.6 All items in Special Collections , the Rare Books Section and those which have heritage and unique value will have priority irrespective of their use in current and continuing courses.   4.5.7 Preservation strategy will be guided by the following principles:  a) respect for the integrity of the original object b) reversibility of treatment wher ever technically feasible c) minimal approach to intervention d) technical documentation of treatment e) respect for cultural diversity and values 16 f) paying due regard to aesthetic, historical, scientific and social dimensions of concerned items  4.5.8 The broad strategy for Preservation will include  a) careful handling of items by staff and users for which periodic preservation training for staff and advice to users would be arranged b) restricted photocopying of materials at risk c) identifying, following and , if needed, developing standard professional protocols for materials in transit between Library -locations, for document delivery, for inter -library loans, for exhibitions and display, for repair and treatment, for transfer and for relegation to Store d) ensuring appropriate storage for acquired material, including oversize and unbound materials such as drawings, architectural plans, graphic prints, cartoons for paintings, newspapers, hand -tinted illuminations in printed books, collotypes, cartographic items, posters, ephemera, oversized unpublished theses etc. e) providing protective measures including boxes, cabinets, large storage units and protective enclosures for Special Collections , Rare Books and Ashoka Archives of Contemporary India f) using gloves, book sofas for heavy and valuable items with vulnerable spines, perspex book - rests, bead- or foam -rests or any other such item serving a similar function by staff and readers as and when required g) ensuring controlled lighting for aging print items and manuscripts h) ensuring appropriate temperature and humidity control for archival items on sensitive materials such as bark, palm leaf, parchment, cloth or paper made from cotton i) observing principles of Preservation and care for items taken out for exhibition and display j) creating user copies in physical or electronic formats for use and exhibitions when the original is deemed vulnerable  4.5.9 The following standards are recommended to ensure appropriate physical environment for Preservation:  a) Th e ideal temperature and humidity level for Preservation of stocks and for user comfort is 20 to 23 degrees Celsius and relative humidity 40% -60%. Conditions may vary according to physical location and its architecture fabric, and seasonal fluctuations. Bar k manuscripts, if acquired, would need a constant temperature of 18 degrees Celsius. Special standards may have to be set for rooms housing unique or heritage objects. Temperature and humidity are to be maintained at controlled levels throughout the day an d throughout the year. Vulnerable items needs to be acclimatized slowly when moved to avoid thermal shock to the material. b) Exposure to sharp light results in degradation in physical materials. Overhead lights in stacks will be switched off when the stac k is not being used. Light from windows in the stacks should be minimal, especially when the storage area is not being used by staff. c) Ultraviolet absorbing window panes, supplemented by infra -red ab sorbing film to control heat may be recommended at the discretion of the Library management . d) Installation of air -filtration system to minimize suspended particulate matter is recommended, especially for the Archives. e) Routine cleaning and pest -control exercises are to be carried out in consultation and supported by the Operations team and authorities entrusted to look after the property. Dusting in controlled atmosphere, however, is to be minimal and gu ided by advice from experts in P reservation of the objects housed. 17 f) Food, drink and pens will not be pe rmitted in the Archives and Special Collections. Only pencils and laptops may be taken inside. g) Photographs of materials in stock using cameras or cameras in mobile phones may be taken only with permission from the library staff in the section. Photograp hs of archival and heritage materials may be taken by special permission only. h) Users of readers of microforms and print -out from microfilms will adhere to the conditions stated in the Library rules.   4.5.10 Microfilming and Digitization  4.5.10.1 Microfilming and digitizing may be outsourced in the absence of in -house capacity. Service providers bidding for work orders and contracts will have to abide by the technical and financial criteria set by the expert assessing committee.  4.5.10.2 Materials will be sourced out only if no damage to the original object is guaranteed in the contract. The condition will apply to other forms of reprography: digital imaging, photocopying, vectoring, dubbing, etc.  4.5.10.3 In particular instances, hybrid cameras fo r microfilming and digitizing simultaneously may be used to protect the object from being subjected to handling twice by agencies —once for microfilming, and again for digitizing. For the same reason materials microfilmed and microfiche d may be digitized wi thout handling the original physical format.  4.5.10.4 In cases where a choice of formats for C onservation of heritage items is available, durability will be a determining factor. Hence, the cause of permanence may be better served by microfilms, while digitization will enhance access, securing the physical object from frequent handling.  4.5.10.5 In the case of bhasha documents , special attention will be paid to Unicode compatibility, skew correction, the possibility of using Optical Character Recognition software and the searchability of digitized items.  4.6 Security The Security of the Univers ity Library pertains to violations of the Library’s building and property through abuse, theft and infringement of Library rules. Violations against persons are subject to other University policies and regulations.  4.6.1 The following actions constitute v iolations of Library security: a) ‘misshelving’ or hiding Library property for exclusive use by an individual user or group b) ignoring notices for return of overdue items c) damaging Library property by mutilation or defacement d) stealing Library propert y and / or possessing stolen items e) removing or trying to remove Library property without permission f) profiting from or smuggling out or unlawfully copying Library property g) refusing to produce membership or identification documents on request from L ibrary staff h) remaining in the Library premises without permission if and when the Library is closed i) inciting others to violate security. 18 4.6.2 Procedures In the interest of security, Library staff are authorized to  a) check books and possessions such as bags of users leaving the Library in spite of the self - check -in and self -check -out facilities b) request users to show identification documents c) question a person found engaged in violating Library rules and security d) report violators to the University authorities for inquiry and disciplinary measures  4.6.3 Disciplinary Procedures  4.6.3.1 Any violation or suspected violation of Library security will be reported for inquiry and equitable disciplinary measures by the compet ent authority appointed by the University.  4.6.3.2 Punitive actions may range from reprimand to dismissal depending on the offence of the user.  4.6.3.3 Law enforcement agencies will be informed in cases of criminal offences.   4.7 Budgetary and Financial Management To meet its mission goals and be consistent with its vision statement, the Library has to supply and sustain resources in its Library and Archive through strategic financial management and practicable budgeting. For this purpose, the C ollection Policy of the Library comprising both Development and Management need supportive funding.  4.7.1 The overall budget proposed by the Library Advisory Committee in consultation with academic Departments, Schools and Centres will be considered by the Head of Finance, and put up to the relevant Finance Committee for approval.*  4.7.2 Interim budg etary supplements for prioritize d immediate needs may be requested by the Library, following the same procedure.  4.7.3 However, al l attempts are to be made to reconcile immediate academic needs with overall aims of long -term Collection Development.  4.7.4 External funding will be sought and accepted in consonance with the nature and goals of the Library.  4.7.5 Private and public so urces of funding may involve conditions and obligations. Once accepted after careful consideration, all such conditions and obligations will be fully met.   4.8 User Access  4.8.1 All bona fide members of the University community may have access to t he resources and services of the library. They include currently enrolled students, faculty, officers and members of the 19 non-teaching staff. Professors Emeriti and retired employees will have access to the resources and services of the Library. They will not be deemed ‘external’ users.  4.8.2 In conformity with the Mission and Vision of the University, the needs of faculty, researchers, students and staff engaged in the approved programmes of teaching and research will have priority in accessing Library se rvices. Extent of services to external users will not be allowed to disrupt the full discharge of obligations to current bona fide members.  4.8.3 External members may b e restricted from accessing specified resources and services at the discretion of the authorities.  4.8.4 Registered alumni and alumnae may use the Library resources and services.

It is aimed towards making the university life of students enriching and well-rounded. Student Affairs cultivates and promotes student learning and development, with a strong commitment towards diversity, inclusion and mutual respect; physical and mental wellbeing; cultural enrichment and creating opportunities for empowerment.      Student Affairs at Ashoka University comprises of Student Life Office, Residence Life Office, and Sports & Exercise Office. Through these very significant and strong components that make up Student Affairs, the Office works towards creating a robust learning and living environment outside the classroom. Each of these branches occupies and crafts intellectually stimulating spaces in their own right. Be it the creative and extracurricular domain of Student Life; the active and invigorating space of the Sports fields; or the ingeniously curated Halls of Residence – each one provides scope and potential for harnessing their skills and talents in a wide sphere of learning. Welcome to this world, where the classroom goes far beyond the walls of physical space; where learning takes place under the bright blue Sonepat skies; where learning takes place within the spaces we reside in; where learning takes place on the sports fields; where learning takes place at music and dance studios and in the art room; where learning takes place amidst the greens and soil at the kitchen garden right next to the Residence Halls! Where learning has no boundaries but only waits for us to create our own and more!      Merit Awards The Merit Awards are guided by the spirit of positive reinforcement and healthy competition. We believe that excellence is achieved by inclusion and not exclusion by way of ranking. The awards are rooted in the philosophy of recognizing merit in every person, who by way of stepping out of their comfort space and pushing boundaries, have been able to contribute towards an enriching and inspiring campus experience for all. The broad spectrum of categories and subcategories for the awards (outlined in the policy) is intended to create a plateau instead of a peak of achievements.        The Series – Trailing Passions and Life Journeys ‘Living the dream’ is a common phrase we all wish we could apply to our lives. All of us strive to achieve our dreams, but until we get there we continue to wonder what it is like to do what we love and succeed at it. Hearing stories from such individuals is often motivation enough to keep on the path to our dreams. The Series is an endeavour where one will bear witness to the stories and experiences of individuals who had the good fortune of excelling at their passions. Having lived their dreams, the stories may just nudge you toward the path to yours.

Our programme, developed bottom-up for the Indian context, is designed to cultivate rigorous writing practices in first-year students. It is our understanding that an education in the liberal arts is built upon the foundation of analytical thinking communicated through clear and persuasive writing across disciplines. The Undergraduate Writing Programme was originally designed to offer one flagship course, Introduction to Critical Thinking, to all Ashoka undergraduates. To foster these critical competencies, our instructors give individual attention to each student’s communication skills, both written and oral, at the level of structure, sentence, and vocabulary. Our flagship course, Introduction to Critical Thinking, is taught through small, seminar-style classes, which employ the best writing pedagogy practices from across the world to nurture writing and critical thinking in the first year of undergraduate training. In the past five years, the programme has evolved a robust, interdisciplinary practice that trains students to articulate their ideas. Our goal is to produce confident, mature communicators, who are at ease writing a research paper, reading an op-ed, or reciting spoken word poetry. We are mindful of student diversity in our classrooms, and ensure that non-native English speakers also find, and claim, their voices.      Over the past few years, the UWP has offered a range of writing courses that cater to a varied incoming student cohort: Introduction to Critical Thinking (ICT), our principal offering, which students must complete in their first year Advanced Academic Writing (AAW), an elective sequel to ICT, which further develops writing and research skills ELT Tutorials, which are capped at 5 students each, and are an immersion critical thinking course for non-native English speakers Our instructors, who come from different disciplines, have also taught Critical Thinking Seminars in other departments, such as Sociology, Environmental Science, and Creative Writing.   We are hiring Instructors for our flagship course, ‘Introduction to Critical Thinking’, for the academic year 2023-2024.

Detailing the life of a national icon, Inquilab Zindabad maps Bhagat Singh’s journey toward revolutionising the Indian freedom struggle and the people and events that influenced this quest. While Inquilab Zindabad sheds light on his family members, friends, comrades and secret benefactors, excerpts from Bhagat Singh’s revolutionary writings on religion, caste and freedom are also present throughout the book.

Our academic counselors aim to connect with high school students from all walks of life through various interactive sessions, webinars, faculty workshops, and admission guidance sessions. Schools can invite our counselors and faculty to conduct a session for their students.

The required details often leave students with queries.  In this session, we will be covering The Undergraduate Programme at Ashoka University (the majors and minors offered) followed by the details that you need to keep in mind while filling out applications and putting together a profile for a university. The other components of the application process i.e. interview, personal essays and documents will also be discussed.    An Ashoka faculty will conduct an interactive session about a specific topic finalized by the professor as well as the school.  **A minimum of 30-50 student registrations are required for this workshop.   With the increased access to popular culture and social media, young people are constantly consuming content that pushes them to think about consent and relationships. And one of the biggest restrictions they face is a lack of suitable spaces to express themselves frankly. This workshop presents and interrogates basic questions around gender and gender-based discrimination. It thinks about the individual’s experience of their gender and how that is navigated. We look at gender roles in popular media in an attempt to build our critical faculties and understand the functioning of the world in which we live. The session covers issues of gendered experience, LGBTQIA+ identities, societal norms, consent, and bullying.   With the help of Ashoka’s Office of Learning Support (OLS) this session will cover how Special Education Needs students can thrive at University Level.  The Office of Learning Support at Ashoka University was set up in 2016. It supports students with  Learning Disabilities. Over the last few years, the Office has supported students with visual impairment, hearing impairment, ASD, ADD/ADHD, Cerebral Palsy along with various specific learning disabilities.   The workshops address the most fundamental aspects of critical thinking and skills required for writing and communication. These are hands-on workshops where students have the opportunity to create a piece of writing of their own and get feedback from our reps. The session also gives students the space to interact with some of the most prominent names in the world of writing. Feel free to reach out to our counselors for further details.

Acknowledging the importance of writing as central to processes of knowledge acquisition, production, and consumption, the programme has developed a pedagogy geared towards building critical reading, writing and thinking skills to help Fellows engage with the world of ideas and enable them to develop and express their own ideas in a well-reasoned, lucid, and engaging manner. We do this by helping students innovate with genres of writing across different disciplines to develop a metacognitive awareness regarding their own reading and writing practices. These skills act as building blocks for the liberal arts education they receive at Ashoka University and enhance their abilities to navigate academic, professional, and social spheres once they graduate from the Fellowship.      The goal of Final Draft, the annual journal of YIF Critical Writing, is to showcase both the range—in topic and genre—and strength of writing in a student body that is itself highly diverse in terms of its educational, disciplinary, professional, geographic, linguistic, and socio-economic backgrounds. Through the process of writing multiple drafts, student-authors discover their own unique voice, and recognise writing as an ongoing, open-ended activity as signalled by the title of the journal itself. As the Fellows learn to bring critical thinking tools to the drawing board, readers of Final Draft can witness a clear attempt by them to negotiate with texts and social phenomena as they make sense of the world around them.

This is a rare freedom within academia and ensures an unparalleled teaching and learning experience, not just for YIF, but across all programmes at Ashoka University.   Ashoka has institutionalised the Socratic way of teaching: focusing on teaching students how to think rather than just what to think. Each course offering is from a distinct academic or professional domain, while several are interdisciplinary in nature. Course offerings include public policy, art appreciation, statistics, data, psychology, philosophy, gender studies, group dynamics, design thinking, communication, international relations and more. Broad course domains are as follows:   Fellows study a total of 20 courses during the year-long programme. Most of these courses are taken by all 100 Fellows, while a few courses are taught in groups of about 25 Fellows, as choice-based Special Seminars. The diversity in courses is also reflected in the varied styles of teaching and assessment, which includes discussions, seminars, field visits, presentations and group work. While catering to multiple learning styles, this allows Fellows to learn from a range of perspectives, and prepare themselves to be critical thinkers who can connect the dots.    Renowned faculty from Ashoka University and partner institutions (such as the University of Pennsylvania), and practitioners from leading institutions globally teach at the YIF.

Fellows come from different geographies, varied education disciplines and socio-economic backgrounds. Many of them excel in extracurricular activities and avocations, and have won accolades in their areas of expertise. A substantial percentage of the cohort also has work experience. With excellent academic support, infrastructure and resources, the Fellowship becomes a platform for the Fellows to share knowledge. At the YIF, an engineer, a filmmaker, a history major, a Kathak dancer, a banker, a social entrepreneur, a pharmacist and a journalist, all attend lectures together. This creates an unparalleled peer learning environment rich with multiple perspectives. Every aspect of the YIF, whether academic, experiential, cultural or informal, allows you to engage with your diverse set of peers in multiple ways and build a close-knit community. Every year, fellows come together to organise the Friends of YIF Day – an opportunity for you and your peers to showcase your talent to members of the Ashoka community. Fellows also self-organize to learn from each other – from Brazilian Jiu Jitsu and becoming a pro at Excel, to learning arts like sculpting and body flow movement.

The online application form has the following sections, not all parts are mandatory: Personal Information Academic Information Professional Information (as applicable) Other Relevant Information (as applicable) Non-Academic Engagement Essay Questions Survey Support at Ashoka (as applicable) Letter(s) of Recommendation (optional during application submission) Please note:  DOCUMENTS: Only a photograph and a government ID are mandatory during submission. However, all other documents including academic transcripts and relevant supporting documents for all professional and non-academic engagements are required for candidates who are shortlisted for the interview stage.  RECOMMENDATION LETTER(S): Upto two Letters of Recommendation (LoRs) can be submitted on behalf of each applicant. Registering the Recommender(s) and submitting the LoR(s) are not mandatory at the time of application submission. Each round of application has a deadline by which the LoRs must be submitted. Please visit the timelines section below for further details.  For any questions, please write to yifadmissions@ashoka.edu.in or sign up for any upcoming sessions with the Office of Admissions.      The YIF selection process is designed to admit a diverse and outstanding class of individuals from India and abroad. The entire process is rigorous and holistic, and involves context specific review. We acknowledge that there are varying levels of access and privilege for different candidates, and as such, each applicant’s submission is reviewed in the applicant’s context. The different stages of the application and selection process are as follows: Stage 1: Holistic Application Assessment (Rolling) This is an elimination stage. Our holistic review involves careful and thorough reading of each application. We take into account the personal context and journey, academic records/professional background, interests and aspirations. The essays section, a critical component of the application, allows the reviewers to understand how applicants think, reflect and engage with ideas and the world around them. We may request a few candidates for a telephonic conversation if we need any clarifications before making a shortlisting decision. (Optional) Application for Need-based Financial Aid (Once in each Round) Candidates may independently apply for need-based financial aid (upto 100%) if shortlisted for the Personal Interview. Candidates also get an opportunity to explore education loans. Please visit the  section to learn more about the philosophy and process to apply for aid. Stage 2: Personal Interview (Rolling) YIF interviews are typically 25-40 minute conversations between the candidate and two panelists (faculty, leadership or alumni). Through this stage, we aim to get to know candidates in depth, and understand how they might benefit from the YIF and how their presence in the cohort might be beneficial to others. We expect candidates to bring forth the most authentic version of themselves. A few candidates may be invited for a second conversation. Stage 3: Decisions (Once in each Round) Applicants would typically receive one of the following decisions: offer of admission, waitlisted for admission or a denial of admission. In case of an offer of admission, candidates will also receive a decision on their Financial Aid package (if awarded). A few admitted candidates would also receive an invitation to interview for the Chancellor’s Merit Scholarship.   The YIF admissions process is split into two rounds. Each round accepts applications within a specified time-frame and selects Fellows from the pool of submitted applications in that round. Please note that you can apply only once in the admissions cycle and only in one round. In case you miss the early round deadline, you can complete your application before the final round deadline. About Rolling Assessments | We encourage candidates to apply early, even within a round. Application assessments and interviews will be conducted on a rolling basis, implying that applications will be assessed as and when they are received. Similarly, interviews will be conducted on priority for those who submit applications early and are shortlisted. The only part of the process that is not rolling is the decision stage, wherein all decisions for candidates in each round will be communicated together.             Early Round          Final Round Application Deadline (Rolling Assessments) 25 December 2022 2 April 2023 Document Upload and Letter(s) of Recommendation Submission Deadline 10 January 2023 1o April 2023 Application for Need-based Financial Aid 6 to 13 January 2023 14 to 20 April 2023 Personal Interviews (Rolling) Mid-December 2022 (for submissions by 1 December 2022) and January 2023 Early-March (for submissions by 15 February), End-March (for submissions by 1 March) and April 2023 Committee Decisions (Offer of Admission and Financial Aid (if applicable), Waitlist or Denial) 16-18 February 2023 Mid-May 2023 Chancellor’s Merit Scholarship Interviews 28 February 2023 23 May 2023 Offer Acceptance Deadline 9 March 2023 24-26 May 2023 Fee Payment Window (typically across three instalments, fee as and if applicable) Early-March to Mid-June 2023 Early-June to Early-August 2023   Other Important Dates: Class of 2024 Offers to Waitlisted Candidates: Latest by Early-July, 2023 Programme Dates: 23rd-24th July, 2023 – Check-in and Arrival 25th-29th July, 2023 – Orientation Activities 31st July, 2023 – First Day of Classes 29th June, 2024 – Graduation Day   Please Note: (1) The above dates are subject to change.

FAQs      20         2 Introduction Physics is a doorway to some of the most beautiful and profound phenomena in the universe like black holes, supernovae, Bose -Einstein condensates, superconductors. It is, simultaneously, a driver of lifestyle -changing technology, e.g., engines, electricity, and transistors; and a powerful way of perceiving and analyzing problems that can be applied in various domains, both within and outside standard physics. The beauty and profundity of the phenomena studied by physicists offer romance and excite passion, and the utility of its discoveries and th e power of its methods arouse interest.  These methods can be very intricate and demanding: theoretical physics requires a skilful combination of physical and mathematical thinking, and experimental physics requires in addition the ability to turn tentati ve ideas into physical devices that can put those ideas to the test. As a result, the successful practice of physics demands rigour, flexibility, mechanical adroitness, persistence, and great imagination. The physicist’s imagination is nourished not just b y physics but also by other areas of human enquiry and thought, of the kind that an Ashoka undergraduate is expected to encounter.  With all of this in mind, the physics programme has been designed to: (i) allow students wishing to major in physics to discov er real physics and make a wise choice, in the first year; (ii) provide, throughout, a thorough training in fundamental physics; (iii) bring together everything learnt earlier, and give students the option to pursue more advanced courses in physics or branch out into other areas, in the third year. The idea is to accompany those wishing to become professional physicists as they take the f irst steps in that direction, and to introduce everyone who goes through the programme to the physicist’s way of thinking.     3 Physics Major – Typical Trajectory Semester 2: Discovering UG -level Physics A student wishing to major, minor, or pursue a concentration in Physics is expected to take the introductory course in calculus (Calculus I) offered by the Mathematics Department. Students wishing to major in Physics should plan to take it in their first s emester.  Requirement for Physics major : 13 core physics courses + 2 electives (60 credits)  The physics -major sequence begins in semester 2, with two courses, one in theoretical physics and the other in experimental physics. The first purpose of these c ourses is to provide an experience of UG level physics on the basis of which a student can decide whether or not to major in physics, i.e., they are gateway courses. The second purpose of these courses is to serve as an introduction to the physicist’s way of thinking about problems and solving them, something that has proved useful not just to physicists but also to those in other disciplines that make use of quantitative methods and experiments, e.g., mathematics, computer science, economics, psychology, a nd biology.  Semester 3, 4 and 5: The Physics Core  The physics courses in these 3 semesters form the core of the physicist’s undergraduate canon. Anyone majoring in physics is expected to be thorough in these areas. Each semester has 2 -3 theory courses and an accompanying lab.  Semester 6: Exploring more advanced options  The student can opt for elective courses: each student majoring in physics is required to take at least two. From the student’s point of view, the electives chosen is likely to indicate a post -graduate direction – towards theoretical physics, towards experimental physics or perhaps away from physics into an allied discipline that would benefit from training in physics.        4 Physics Minor or Concentration  To Minor in physics a student must do six courses in physics (24 credits). Of these the two gateway courses – MP1 and Lab 1 – are compulsory. At least two more courses should be taken from among the core courses offered in semesters 3, 4, and 5, provided a ppropriate prerequisites have been satisfied for these courses (recommended courses: Classical Mechanics and Thermal Physics).  The remaining two may be either other compulsory or elective courses offered by the Physics Department or cross -listed with Phy sics, provided appropriate prerequisites have been satisfied. In place of one elective course, a student may take an Independent Study Module (ISM) of equivalent credit.  For a Concentration in physics a student must do six courses in physics (16 credits ). Of these the two gateway courses – MP1 and Lab 1 – are compulsory.  At least two more courses should be taken from among the core courses offered in semesters 3, 4, and 5, provided appropriate prerequisites have been satisfied for these courses (recomm ended courses: Classical Mechanics and Thermal Physics)          5 General Information on the Physics Courses Mathematical level — All theory courses are calculus -based. The level of mathematical sophistication will increase progressively. The mathematical - physics courses will be application -oriented rather than proof -oriented. Familiarity with +2 level physics and mathematics is a ssumed.  Labs — All lab courses will involve extensive use of instruments to make observations. These experiments will in general illustrate ideas studied in the accompanying theory courses.  The use of computers — Many theory courses will include computa tional exercises, generally using the programming language Python. Labs will also require the use of computers.  Duration — Theory courses: two lectures a week each lasting 1.5 hours. In addition, there may be a 1.5 -hour tutorial per week . Laboratory: one 3 -hour main lab session per week and one 3 -hour extra session per week for lab course.  List of Physics Courses Compulsory/Core Courses Mathematical Physics 1 (Gateway course: semester 2) This course aims to familiarise the student with a variety of mathematical techniques which every student of physics should be conversant with. Having taken the course, you should be comfortable with casting a wide variety of physics problems in mathematical language and being able to analyse and solve them subsequently. The course will also include an introduction to programming with Python. Within the physics curriculu m at Ashoka university, this course is an essential prerequisite for Classical Mechanics and Electricity and Magnetism in Light of Relativity offered in the third semester.  Pre-requisites: Students who have not done mathematics at the 12th -grade level are required to take Calculus I.     6 Physics Lab 1 (Gateway course: semester 2) An introduction to physics through experiments. The goal of this introductory lab is to help students develop the skills needed for experimental physics. Students will be introduced to the basic concepts of data collection, analysis, and interpretation over the span of the course by working on different experimental problems which have been carefully selected to represent different branches of physics.  Pre-requis ites: none.  Classical Mechanics (semester 3) Newtonian mechanics and an introduction to Lagrangian and Hamiltonian mechanics. Newtonian mechanics is, both historically and otherwise, the starting point of all of physics. The Lagrangian and Hamiltonian formulations of classical mechanics allow a more profound vision of the subject while also introducing the language in which much of higher -level theoretical physics is expressed.  Pre-requisites: MP1  Electricity & Magnetism in Light of Relativity (semester 3 ) The beautiful theory of electricity and magnetism is, with classical mechanics, the heart of c lassical physics. What is often not appreciated at the undergraduate level is that electricity and magnetism are related in a way that reveals the structure of space -time. In this course relativity will be used from the beginning to relate electric and mag netic fields, so that their unity, as components of the electromagnetic field are revealed and used in the study of Maxwell’s Equations.  Pre-requisites: MP1  Physics Lab 2 (semester 3) Designed to accompany the theory courses Classical Mechanics and Ele ctricity & Magnetism in Light of Relativity, this laboratory course explores their experimental foundations. Students will be introduced to video -analysis and modelling to study elastic and inelastic collisions, uniformly accelerated motion, and terminal v elocity. In addition, students will also be introduced to physical systems exhibiting electromagnetic damping, resonant electronics circuits, and two -dimensional electrostatics.  Pre-requisites: Physics Lab 1      7 Mathematical Physics 2 (semester 4 ) This mathematical physics course aims to be an introduction to differential equations. Besides standard topics in ordinary and partial differential equations, nonlinear dynamical systems will be studied and nonlinear ODEs will be analysed using geometric a nd computational tools. Fourier series will also be studied.  Pre-requisites: MP1  Thermal Physics (semester 4) An Integrated Approach to Thermodynamics and Kinetic Theory. There are three approaches to study systems with large numbers of atoms and molec ules, which exhibit properties like temperature and entropy: kinetic theory, classical thermodynamics, and statistical mechanics. In this course, these three approaches will be taught in an integrated fashion.  Pre-requisites: Mathematical Physics 1.  Oscillations, Waves, and Optics (semester 4) Oscillatory phenomena appear in all areas of physics, both classical and quantum (to the point where a famous textbook begins by saying that the domain of physics is all phenomena that can be reduced to coupled oscillators). The methods used to study oscillatory motion are powerful and wide -ranging in their utility.  Pre-requisites: MP1, Classical Mechanics and Electricity & Magnetism.  Physics Lab 3 (semester 4) Designed to accompany the theory courses Therma l Physics and Oscillations, Waves & Optics, this laboratory course explores their experimental foundations. Students will be introduced to the properties of light as a wave: interference, diffraction, and polarisation, through conceptually rich experiments like the Michelson Interferometer. In addition, mechanical systems which exhibit oscillatory behaviour, like coupled pendula and capillary waves, will also be studied. Students will also be introduced to ideas of thermometry and calibration.  Pre-requisi tes: Physics Lab I.        8 Quantum Mechanics (semester 5) This course is an introduction to Quantum Mechanics (QM). Starting with a historical introduction and motivation, it goes on to introduce probability amplitudes as the fundamental physical basis for QM. Using the Dirac bra -ket notation, the fundamental postulates are then introduced and their consequences worked out. The basic physical concepts are illustrated through spin -½ systems and one -dimensional wave mechanics. Symmetries and Conservation laws in QM are discussed, an introduction to the basic theory of angular momentum and spin is given, and the course culminates with the first major triumph of QM - a quantum mechanical understanding of the hydrogen atom.  Pre-requisites: Classical Mechanics, M athematical Physics I and II.  Strongly recommended: Linear Algebra (Department of Mathematics).  Statistical Mechanics (semester 5) Statistical mechanics allows one to solve problems involving large numbers of particles by exploiting statistical regularities. When combined with quantum mechanics, it helps physicists to understand some of the most fascinating phenomena in the universe. This course is an introduction to the essential concepts of the subject.  Pre-requisites: Thermal Physics.  Physics Lab 4 (semester 5) Designed to accompany the two theory courses Quantum Mechanics and Statistical Mechanics; this laboratory course explor es their experimental foundations. Students will be introduced to some of the experiments which require Quantum Mechanics in order to be explained, notably discrete atomic spectra and the Zeeman Effect. The lab will also contain experiments on Brownian Mot ion and the determination of other properties of matter like magnetic susceptibility.  Pre-requisites: Physics Lab I.  The Physics of Matter (semester 6 ) In real physical systems the various areas of fundamental physics that are studied separately in pre vious semesters are usually required all at once. The purpose of this course is to show how fundamental physics can be used to study a number of interesting phenomena.  Pre-requisites: All mandatory courses in the physics -major sequence.     9 Elective Physics Courses  Elective courses (for the 3rd and 4th year) are listed below.

Alternatively, students wishing to broaden their education further can use it to take a minor/concentration in any other subject or simply take whatev er courses in any department they wish to.  Advanced Major The advanced major is for students intending to pursue higher studies and research in physics. It would enable them to take some advanced physics courses as well as get an idea of research through the capstone project/thesis.  Requirements: 7th Semester: Required to take 16 credits of which the capstone project comprises 8 credits. The students can opt for 1 or 2 courses comprising 4 credits/course.  8th Semester: Required to take 16 credits of which the capstone project comprises 8 credits. The students can opt for 1 or 2 courses comprising 4 credits/course.  Over the whole year (2 semesters), some courses apart from Thesis may also be taken from outside the physics department .     11 Capstone Project and Thesis:  Interested students should talk, in their 6th semester, to prospective advisors about possible projects. After mutual agreement - the advisor agrees to guide the student and the student agrees to work on one of the projects suggested by the advisor - stude nts should start with necessary background reading / preliminary work over the summer before the start of the fourth year.  At the end of the 7th semester the project would be assessed with a presentation and report - this will be evaluated by the physics faculty. Students without satisfactory progress at this stage may not continue for the thesis subsequently.  At the end of the 8th semester the thesis has to be submitted and defended before a panel which may also include some external members. It is mandatory to successfully complete the capstone project and thesis to be eligible for the advanced major.  Other options (Minor/Concentration)  Students not opting for the advanced major can take courses as per their interest in the fourth year. It is reco mmended that physics majors take two physics electives over the year. Those minoring in physics (or taking it as a concentration) may take physics courses accordingly to meet the necessary requirements.               12 TF/TA -ship Policy ❖ The Teaching Fellows are recruited after a departmental screening process.  ❖ Fourth year (ASP) physics students can be TAs for some of the introductory physics courses. This depends on the departmental requirement and the position may be offered either for credits or may be a paid position.  ❖ MLS students are assigned to be TAs as a part of their academic requirements.  Independent Study Module (ISM) ❖ Students may opt for an ISM if interested and if a faculty member is available for this purpose.  ❖ A successfully completed ISM would contribute 2 to 4 credits to the student’s GPA.  ❖ Students who wish to take up an ISM should contact the Professor under whose guidance they wish to work to discuss details.       13 Faculty  Somendra M.

Answer: The gateway courses (Mathematical and Computational Toolkit and Laboratory 1) are the mandatory courses to pursue a physics minor. Apart from these two, the student is expected to take 4 courses of their choice. Of these 4 courses at least two should be taken from among the other core courses. The remaining two can be core or elective courses and one of them can also be an ISM. So, in total a student has to do 6 courses to complete a minor in Physics.  2. What are the mandatory courses for a concentration in Physics? Answer: The gateway courses (Mathematical and Computational Toolkit and Laboratory 1) are the mandatory courses to pursue a physics concentration. Apart from these two, the student is expected to take 2 courses of their choice from among the core courses. So, in total a student has to do 4 courses to complete a concentration in Physics.  3. What are the man datory courses for the Ashoka Scholar Programme (ASP) students? Answer: A project (Capstone project) and the Capstone thesis are mandatory for an Advanced Major in Physics.      21 4. Will the mandatory courses be offered every semester? Answer: The mandatory gateway courses are offered in the spring semesters. Other core courses are spread throughout the 6 semesters. All courses are not offered in every semester.  5. What are the prerequisites to major in Physics? Answer: The student is expected to have a sci ence/mathematics background in their high school (at +2 level). Calculus is a recommended course to be taken in their first semester.  6. I am interested in doing a TAship/writing a thesis although I’m not in my fourth year as yet.

Answer: You can reach out to the Academic Representative of the Department.  8. Is thesis mandatory for ASP students? Answer: Thesis is mandatory for an Advanced Major in Physics. See also Q 9.     22 9. Do the ASP 4th year count as an Advanced Major? Answer: Yes. But only if the capstone project + thesis option is chosen. Otherwise, the fourth year may be used to get a double major / minor in other subjects.  10. Will the labs be independent of the theory courses - in terms of number of credits? Answer: Yes. They are independent of the theory courses in terms of the number of credits - 4 credits for each theory course or lab.     ",f1d1c141-abab-4c76-b15f-81d27b83706a
526,"HISTORY HANDBOOK   GUIDELINES FOR UG STUDENTS             DEPARTMENT OF HISTORY   ASHOKA UNIVERSITY               (LAST UPDATED ON 25 AUGUST 2020) 1  The Department of History     The History Major at Ashoka University seeks both to equip students with the historian’s                             toolbox and trains them on how to use it. A historian combines the skills of a detective, a                                     scavenger, a judge and a ventriloquist. S/he is an artist and a skilled craftsperson who spins and                                   weaves narratives of the past. Historical creativity lies in gathering, wrestling with, and                           connecting the traces of the past to construct a rich tapestry of human lives, emotions, and                                 ideas. These traces come in various garbs – gravestones, burial sites, forgotten cities, mud                             pots, musical notes, folklores, war songs, memoirs, archival records, speeches, letters,                       newspapers, cartoons, cave art, paintings, architecture, clothes, food, chronicles, cinema,                     advertisements – all and any remnant of human existence.   A historian’s ability to make effective use of these materials requires inculcation of two                             core ideas: empathy and imagination. Empathy fuels and glues our connection with other                           humans. It helps us recognize others’ perceptions, feelings and ways of being. Empathy is a                               vital tool of a historian because it obligates a historian to question and challenge a single                                 conception of the world in order to access other worlds and other lives. Thus the spirit of                                   questioning and the consciousness of one’s own frames of reference is the starting point of                               historical inquiry. The second feature of imagination is the creative faculty which enables us to                               form images and feelings that ordinary senses cannot perceive. It is a critical instrument for a                                 historian who studies worlds that are removed both in time and space from his or her own.                                   Conjuring up those historical worlds requires a leap of imagination, a willing suspension of                             disbelief and a readiness to encounter the unknown.       HISTORY MAJOR, MINOR, & CONCENTRATION     The Department of History requires students to take a total of ​ 12 courses in three years in order                                     to receive the History Major degree and ​ 10 to receive the History-IR Major degree, according to                                 UGC guidelines. However, the course should be considered as a four year programme,                           including the ‘Advanced Major’, which brings the total courses to 16 in four years for History                                 Majors and 14 for History-IR Majors.     History students have to do a mix of compulsory and elective courses. Compulsory                           courses provide students with a basic grounding in the discipline. Elective courses seek to stir,                               whet, and capture a student’s historical imagination through a conceptual, historiographical                       and methodological study of different historical themes and subjects. In addition, the UG                           Research Thesis/Project (for third-year students) and the Capstone Thesis (for ASP students)                         offer History students opportunities to put into practice their understanding of the discipline of                             history by undertaking independent inquiry on their chosen historical themes.     2  History Curriculum       History Core Courses:   A.​ ​ GATEWAY COURSES:   ● HIS-1001 European History from Renaissance to Revolution (Spring)   ● HIS-2001 History of India I: From Prehistoric Beginnings to the Mauryan Empire   (Spring)   ● HIS-2002 History of India II: From the Mauryan Empire to c. 1000 CE   (Monsoon)   ● HIS-2003 History of India III: From c. 1000 CE to 1764 CE (Spring)   ● HIS-2004 History of India IV: From 1764 CE to 1967 CE (Spring)     B.

For a Major in History, students must take a total of ​ 12 ​ courses in History. History                                   majors must take ​ all 5 gateway courses (HIS 1001, HIS 2001, HIS 2002, HIS 2003, and HIS                                   2004). These five gateway courses give students a solid foundation in the history of the general                                 patterns and processes of Indian and modern European history within a global comparative                           framework. These courses provide students with chronological anchors for more advanced                       thematic courses.   Along with the gateways, ​ 2 reading courses, (HIS-3001 & HIS-3002) equip students with                           the basic apparatus of the historical craft. Reading History introduces students to different                           theories that have influenced historical imagination, the various schools of thought and modes                           of writing history such as positivism, Marxism, annals, structuralism, post-structuralism,                     postmodernism and postcolonialism. Reading Archaeology introduces students to the methods                     and theories of archaeology globally, and engages students with the history of archaeological                           thought.             3    History Majors ​ need to complete ​ 12​ History courses.

The distribution of these ​ 4 courses follows two                             trajectories, depending on the batch:     For UG batches that joined Ashoka till 2018:     4​ additional History courses:       ● any combination of History electives, electives of other departments that are                       cross-listed with History, Independent Study Modules (ISM), CTS that is                     cross-listed with History, language course (Persian/ Sanskrit), and/or History                   UG Research Thesis/Project.     For UG batches joining Ashoka from 2019 onward:     4​ additional History courses:       ● 4 additional History courses, which may be any combination of History electives,                         electives of other departments that are cross-listed with History, Independent                     Study Modules (ISM), CTS that is cross-listed with History, and/or History UG                         Research Thesis/Project, ​ including at least 2 History electives offered by the                       Department of History.     Note: No more than 1 CTS and 1 language course (Persian/ Sanskrit) will count towards a   History elective.     The Department of History ​ strongly recommends the following sequence for taking the 6                           compulsory History courses:     7   Semester   Recommended Sequence for Taking the 7 Compulsory History Course(s)   1   None   2   HIS-1001     European History   HIS-2001   History of India I   --   3   HIS-2002   History of India II   --   --   4   HIS-2003   History of India III   HIS-2004   History of India IV   HIS-3001   Reading History   5   None   6   None  History & Economics Interdisciplinary Major     For the History and Economics Interdisciplinary major ​ 17 ​ courses ​ are required, including ​ 8                           each from History and Economics and ​ 1​ last from either.       Note: For History, no more than 1 CTS may count as an elective.       The 16 courses include the following:       ● 7​ Economics required courses   ○ Maths for Economics   ○ Intermediate Microeconomics   ○ Intermediate Macroeconomics   ○ Statistics for Economics   ○ Econometrics   ○ Game Theory   ○ Development Economics     ● 1​ Economics elective course       ● 5​ History Gateway Courses   ○ HIS 1001 European History from Renaissance to Revolution   ○ HIS 2001 History of India I   ○ HIS 2002 History of India II   ○ HIS 2003 History of India III   ○ HIS 2004 History of India IV     ● 1​ History Reading Course   ○ HIS 3001 Reading History     ● 2 additional History courses, which may be any combination of History electives,                         electives of other departments that are cross-listed with History, Independent                     Study Modules (ISM), CTS that is cross-listed with History, language course                       (Persian/ Sanskrit), and/or History UG Research Thesis/Project, ​ including at                   least 1 History elective offered by the Department of History.     Note: No more than 1 CTS and 1 language course (Persian/ Sanskrit) will count as a   History Elective.             8  The Department of History ​ strongly recommends the following sequence for taking the 6                           compulsory History courses:           The Undergraduate Thesis/Project     History and History-IR Interdisciplinary Major students can choose to do an Undergraduate                         Thesis/Project (HIS-3991/3992) in their fifth semester. The Undergraduate Thesis/Project is a                       semester-long research venture. It comprises 4 credits. This offers students a scope of engaging                             in an extended intellectual journey, where one gets to study a particular historical issue closely                               under the guidance of a faculty member.     Interested students should finalise a topic for the thesis/project in course of their fourth                             semester. They should approach faculty member(s) who they think might be interested in                           guiding them in that topic. By the end of the fourth semester, interested students are required                                 to submit their proposal for the Undergraduate Thesis/Project to the History UG Thesis/Project                           Coordinator (currently Prof. Nayanjot Lahiri). Before the onset of the fifth semester, potential                           supervisors will assess the amount and quality of work done by the student(s) till then and                                 decide if the student(s) can proceed to do the Undergraduate Thesis/Project. The decision of the                               concerned faculty member will be binding. The thesis is to be researched and written in course                                 of the monsoon semester and submitted at the end of it. Every thesis is evaluated by two faculty                                     members, one being the supervisor.     For further details and guidance, students should contact Prof. Nayanjot Lahiri.       9   Semester   Compulsory History Course(s) to be taken   1   None   2   HIS-1001     European History   HIS-2001   History of India I   --   3   HIS-2002   History of India II   --   --   4   HIS-2003   History of India III   HIS-2004   History of India IV   HIS-3002   Reading History   5   None   6   None  The 4th Year - Ashoka Scholars Programme (ASP)     At Ashoka University, students can opt for the Ashoka Scholars’ Programme (ASP), which                           comprises a fourth year after the completion of graduation at the end of the third year. For the                                     History Department, this comprises the History Advanced Major programme. This extra year is                           aimed at equipping our students towards research in the discipline through immersive                         research-oriented coursework and academic writing.       History Advanced Major Requirements     The History Advanced Major comprises ​ 16 credits​ . Students can choose to opt for this in their                                 4th year (Ashoka Scholar’s Programme or ASP). Once they do, they will be required to take three                                   additional courses in History at the advanced level. The first two among these courses are                               exclusive to the rigorous research-oriented training that the History Advanced Major                       programme comprises:     i​ . ​ HIS-4001 & HIS-4002. Sources and Histories I & II (4 credits)​ :     This course is intended to impart first-hand research training to 4th-year History students.                           This course is co-taught by the entire departmental faculty. In the course, students collectively                             read, discuss, and analyse primary source material along with a faculty member. Faculty                           members circulate the source(s) for her class beforehand, with a brief note and a few leading                                 questions. Students read the sources before the class, bring their notes to the class for a                                 discussion led by the faculty member, and then submit their reflections in writing before the                               next class. Students get an opportunity to study a diverse array of primary sources drawn from                                 various periods of South Asian history.     Note: This course has a total of ​ 4 credits, but is offered in two parts over two semesters. ​ Sources                                       and Histories I (with 2 credits) is offered in the Monsoon Semester and ​ Sources and Histories                                 II (with 2 credits) is offered in the Spring Semester. History Advanced Major students must                               take ​ both​ parts of this course in order to complete a total of 4 credits.     ii.​ ​ HIS-4983. History Capstone Thesis/Project (8 credits)​ :     Students pursuing History Advanced Major are required to do a Capstone Thesis/Project. In                           contrast to the UG Research Thesis, which is done over one semester only, the Capstone thesis                                 is a year-long research venture. It comprises ​ 8 credits. The greater time and credit is meant to                                   offer students an advanced intellectual exercise and an opportunity to work extensively with                           primary sources under the close guidance of a faculty member. Planning so this is to be started                                   by students by the end of their third year at Ashoka. Students have to seek out faculty members                                     with similar areas of interest for potential supervision.For further details and guidance,                         interested students should contact the current History ASP Coordinator Dr Aparna Vaidik.   10  Note: The Capstone Thesis/Project can be done even without doing a Major or Advanced Major                               in History.     iii​ . ​ Any one History Elective/ISM at the 300/400 level (4 credits):     All fourth-year students - whether pursuing a History Advanced Major or not - are assigned a                                 faculty mentor, who watches over the intellectual development of the student throughout the                           year.   In addition to these courses, History Major students pursuing the ASP can also opt to do one or   more Teaching Practicum Assistantships.       History-IR Advanced Major Requirements     During the fourth year at Ashoka, students who opt for the History-IR Advanced Major are                               required to take three additional courses in History and IR at the advanced level. These are:     i. Sources and Histories (4 credits)   ii.​ ​ History or IR Capstone Thesis (8 credits)   iii.​ ​ Any IR Elective/ISM at the 300/400 level (4 credits)​ :     In addition to these courses, History-IR Major students pursuing the ASP can also opt to do one   or more Teaching Practicum Assistantships.       Teaching Practicum (2 credits)     The Teaching Practicum introduces students to the world of pedagogy. The Teaching Practicum                           Assistant (TPA) participates in the lesson planning process, ideally meeting the faculty member                           to discuss class preparation at least once per week. The TPA is expected to (re)read the assigned                                   readings, and may be given additional readings by the faculty in preparation for class                             discussions. The TPA is responsible for assisting the faculty with setting up the classroom and                               holding office hours outside of the class meetings (2 hrs per week) to meet with the students to                                     continue the discussion, help them with paper topics and writing, and other course-related                           questions.   TPA’s will ​ not be responsible for grading or evaluating other students’ work, except                           occasionally may be involved in the grading process with the faculty in order to learn how                                 grading is done. The Teaching Practicum is considered as an apprenticeship, in which the                             faculty member is responsible to mentor, teach, and train the TPA in pedagogical methods.                             11  TPA’s will also be required to attend pedagogy workshops during the Orientation week. The TPA                               may be assigned readings over and above the syllabus readings for the rest of the course. The                                   workload should not exceed 3 hrs outside of class time per week.   Every Teaching Practicum carries 2 credits. Students who wish to register for a                           Teaching Practicum will need to apply to the ASP Coordinator of the Department of History                               (currently Dr Aparna Vaidik) by July for the Monsoon Semester and by December for the Spring                                 Semester. The History Teaching Practicum is meant primarily for History and History-IR                         Major students who are pursuing the ASP in their fourth year. Other students, including                             third-year students, may apply for this. The selection of students as TPAs and their allocation to                                 individual courses will be done by the History faculty, taking into account the quality of the                                 applications and pedagogical requirements. The decision and choice of the concerned faculty                         member will be binding.     For further details and guidance about the History ASP, interested students should contact the                             History ASP Coordinator Dr. Aparna Vaidik.       Language Courses     The Department of History currently offers two languages - Sanskrit and Persian. The objective                             for this is to equip History students for historical research in the future. The department                               strongly encourages its students to learn at least one of these languages while they are at                                 Ashoka. Currently, ​ any ​ one language course (Persian/ Sanskrit) can count in lieu of ​ one History                               elective in the total course tally of History students. Beyond this, students can take as many                                 language courses as they want. In future, the department will explore options for making more                               language courses available for its students.     Language Courses currently on offer:     Monsoon Semester:     HIS-5511. Persian 1     HIS-5501. Sanskrit 1   HIS-5503. Sanskrit 3     Spring Semester:       HIS-5502. Sanskrit 2   HIS-5504. Sanskrit 4     For any queries, students should contact Prof. Mahesh Rangarajan (Head, Department of   History).   12    CAPSTONE & UG RESEARCH THESIS/PROJECT FORM   Form Must Be Filled And Submitted Before Course Registration in Monsoon Semester       Student Name: _______________________________________________________________________     ▢ ​ UG Research Thesis ​ ▢ ​ UG Research Project ​ ▢ ​ 4th Year Capstone  ( ✔ one)     Title: _______________________________________________________________________________     _____________________________________________________________________________________     _____________________________________________________________________________________     Supervising Faculty Name:_____________________________________________________________       Student Signature: __________________________________________ Date: ___________________     Supervisor Signature: _______________________________________ Date: ____________________     Research Coordinator Signature: ______________________________ Date: ___________________         CAPSTONE & UG RESEARCH THESIS/PROJECT FORM   Form Must Be Filled And Submitted Before Course Registration in Spring Semester       Student Name: _______________________________________________________________________     ▢ ​ UG Research Thesis ​ ▢ ​ UG Research Project ​ ▢ ​ 4th Year Capstone  ( ✔ one)     Title: ________________________________________________________________________________     _____________________________________________________________________________________     _____________________________________________________________________________________     Supervising Faculty Name: ____________________________________________________________     Student Signature: __________________________________________ Date: ___________________     Supervisor Signature: _______________________________________ Date: ____________________     Research Coordinator Signature: _____________________________ Date: ____________________   13  ",a018eb5e-0937-4824-b0c8-9043bb302419

FAQs      20         2 Introduction Physics is a doorway to some of the most beautiful and profound phenomena in the universe like black holes, supernovae, Bose -Einstein condensates, superconductors. It is, simultaneously, a driver of lifestyle -changing technology, e.g., engines, electricity, and transistors; and a powerful way of perceiving and analyzing problems that can be applied in various domains, both within and outside standard physics. The beauty and profundity of the phenomena studied by physicists offer romance and excite passion, and the utility of its discoveries and th e power of its methods arouse interest.  These methods can be very intricate and demanding: theoretical physics requires a skilful combination of physical and mathematical thinking, and experimental physics requires in addition the ability to turn tentati ve ideas into physical devices that can put those ideas to the test. As a result, the successful practice of physics demands rigour, flexibility, mechanical adroitness, persistence, and great imagination. The physicist’s imagination is nourished not just b y physics but also by other areas of human enquiry and thought, of the kind that an Ashoka undergraduate is expected to encounter.  With all of this in mind, the physics programme has been designed to: (i) allow students wishing to major in physics to discov er real physics and make a wise choice, in the first year; (ii) provide, throughout, a thorough training in fundamental physics; (iii) bring together everything learnt earlier, and give students the option to pursue more advanced courses in physics or branch out into other areas, in the third year. The idea is to accompany those wishing to become professional physicists as they take the f irst steps in that direction, and to introduce everyone who goes through the programme to the physicist’s way of thinking.     3 Physics Major – Typical Trajectory Semester 2: Discovering UG -level Physics A student wishing to major, minor, or pursue a concentration in Physics is expected to take the introductory course in calculus (Calculus I) offered by the Mathematics Department. Students wishing to major in Physics should plan to take it in their first s emester.  Requirement for Physics major : 13 core physics courses + 2 electives (60 credits)  The physics -major sequence begins in semester 2, with two courses, one in theoretical physics and the other in experimental physics. The first purpose of these c ourses is to provide an experience of UG level physics on the basis of which a student can decide whether or not to major in physics, i.e., they are gateway courses. The second purpose of these courses is to serve as an introduction to the physicist’s way of thinking about problems and solving them, something that has proved useful not just to physicists but also to those in other disciplines that make use of quantitative methods and experiments, e.g., mathematics, computer science, economics, psychology, a nd biology.  Semester 3, 4 and 5: The Physics Core  The physics courses in these 3 semesters form the core of the physicist’s undergraduate canon. Anyone majoring in physics is expected to be thorough in these areas. Each semester has 2 -3 theory courses and an accompanying lab.  Semester 6: Exploring more advanced options  The student can opt for elective courses: each student majoring in physics is required to take at least two. From the student’s point of view, the electives chosen is likely to indicate a post -graduate direction – towards theoretical physics, towards experimental physics or perhaps away from physics into an allied discipline that would benefit from training in physics.        4 Physics Minor or Concentration  To Minor in physics a student must do six courses in physics (24 credits). Of these the two gateway courses – MP1 and Lab 1 – are compulsory. At least two more courses should be taken from among the core courses offered in semesters 3, 4, and 5, provided a ppropriate prerequisites have been satisfied for these courses (recommended courses: Classical Mechanics and Thermal Physics).  The remaining two may be either other compulsory or elective courses offered by the Physics Department or cross -listed with Phy sics, provided appropriate prerequisites have been satisfied. In place of one elective course, a student may take an Independent Study Module (ISM) of equivalent credit.  For a Concentration in physics a student must do six courses in physics (16 credits ). Of these the two gateway courses – MP1 and Lab 1 – are compulsory.  At least two more courses should be taken from among the core courses offered in semesters 3, 4, and 5, provided appropriate prerequisites have been satisfied for these courses (recomm ended courses: Classical Mechanics and Thermal Physics)          5 General Information on the Physics Courses Mathematical level — All theory courses are calculus -based. The level of mathematical sophistication will increase progressively. The mathematical - physics courses will be application -oriented rather than proof -oriented. Familiarity with +2 level physics and mathematics is a ssumed.  Labs — All lab courses will involve extensive use of instruments to make observations. These experiments will in general illustrate ideas studied in the accompanying theory courses.  The use of computers — Many theory courses will include computa tional exercises, generally using the programming language Python. Labs will also require the use of computers.  Duration — Theory courses: two lectures a week each lasting 1.5 hours. In addition, there may be a 1.5 -hour tutorial per week . Laboratory: one 3 -hour main lab session per week and one 3 -hour extra session per week for lab course.  List of Physics Courses Compulsory/Core Courses Mathematical Physics 1 (Gateway course: semester 2) This course aims to familiarise the student with a variety of mathematical techniques which every student of physics should be conversant with. Having taken the course, you should be comfortable with casting a wide variety of physics problems in mathematical language and being able to analyse and solve them subsequently. The course will also include an introduction to programming with Python. Within the physics curriculu m at Ashoka university, this course is an essential prerequisite for Classical Mechanics and Electricity and Magnetism in Light of Relativity offered in the third semester.  Pre-requisites: Students who have not done mathematics at the 12th -grade level are required to take Calculus I.     6 Physics Lab 1 (Gateway course: semester 2) An introduction to physics through experiments. The goal of this introductory lab is to help students develop the skills needed for experimental physics. Students will be introduced to the basic concepts of data collection, analysis, and interpretation over the span of the course by working on different experimental problems which have been carefully selected to represent different branches of physics.  Pre-requis ites: none.  Classical Mechanics (semester 3) Newtonian mechanics and an introduction to Lagrangian and Hamiltonian mechanics. Newtonian mechanics is, both historically and otherwise, the starting point of all of physics. The Lagrangian and Hamiltonian formulations of classical mechanics allow a more profound vision of the subject while also introducing the language in which much of higher -level theoretical physics is expressed.  Pre-requisites: MP1  Electricity & Magnetism in Light of Relativity (semester 3 ) The beautiful theory of electricity and magnetism is, with classical mechanics, the heart of c lassical physics. What is often not appreciated at the undergraduate level is that electricity and magnetism are related in a way that reveals the structure of space -time. In this course relativity will be used from the beginning to relate electric and mag netic fields, so that their unity, as components of the electromagnetic field are revealed and used in the study of Maxwell’s Equations.  Pre-requisites: MP1  Physics Lab 2 (semester 3) Designed to accompany the theory courses Classical Mechanics and Ele ctricity & Magnetism in Light of Relativity, this laboratory course explores their experimental foundations. Students will be introduced to video -analysis and modelling to study elastic and inelastic collisions, uniformly accelerated motion, and terminal v elocity. In addition, students will also be introduced to physical systems exhibiting electromagnetic damping, resonant electronics circuits, and two -dimensional electrostatics.  Pre-requisites: Physics Lab 1      7 Mathematical Physics 2 (semester 4 ) This mathematical physics course aims to be an introduction to differential equations. Besides standard topics in ordinary and partial differential equations, nonlinear dynamical systems will be studied and nonlinear ODEs will be analysed using geometric a nd computational tools. Fourier series will also be studied.  Pre-requisites: MP1  Thermal Physics (semester 4) An Integrated Approach to Thermodynamics and Kinetic Theory. There are three approaches to study systems with large numbers of atoms and molec ules, which exhibit properties like temperature and entropy: kinetic theory, classical thermodynamics, and statistical mechanics. In this course, these three approaches will be taught in an integrated fashion.  Pre-requisites: Mathematical Physics 1.  Oscillations, Waves, and Optics (semester 4) Oscillatory phenomena appear in all areas of physics, both classical and quantum (to the point where a famous textbook begins by saying that the domain of physics is all phenomena that can be reduced to coupled oscillators). The methods used to study oscillatory motion are powerful and wide -ranging in their utility.  Pre-requisites: MP1, Classical Mechanics and Electricity & Magnetism.  Physics Lab 3 (semester 4) Designed to accompany the theory courses Therma l Physics and Oscillations, Waves & Optics, this laboratory course explores their experimental foundations. Students will be introduced to the properties of light as a wave: interference, diffraction, and polarisation, through conceptually rich experiments like the Michelson Interferometer. In addition, mechanical systems which exhibit oscillatory behaviour, like coupled pendula and capillary waves, will also be studied. Students will also be introduced to ideas of thermometry and calibration.  Pre-requisi tes: Physics Lab I.        8 Quantum Mechanics (semester 5) This course is an introduction to Quantum Mechanics (QM). Starting with a historical introduction and motivation, it goes on to introduce probability amplitudes as the fundamental physical basis for QM. Using the Dirac bra -ket notation, the fundamental postulates are then introduced and their consequences worked out. The basic physical concepts are illustrated through spin -½ systems and one -dimensional wave mechanics. Symmetries and Conservation laws in QM are discussed, an introduction to the basic theory of angular momentum and spin is given, and the course culminates with the first major triumph of QM - a quantum mechanical understanding of the hydrogen atom.  Pre-requisites: Classical Mechanics, M athematical Physics I and II.  Strongly recommended: Linear Algebra (Department of Mathematics).  Statistical Mechanics (semester 5) Statistical mechanics allows one to solve problems involving large numbers of particles by exploiting statistical regularities. When combined with quantum mechanics, it helps physicists to understand some of the most fascinating phenomena in the universe. This course is an introduction to the essential concepts of the subject.  Pre-requisites: Thermal Physics.  Physics Lab 4 (semester 5) Designed to accompany the two theory courses Quantum Mechanics and Statistical Mechanics; this laboratory course explor es their experimental foundations. Students will be introduced to some of the experiments which require Quantum Mechanics in order to be explained, notably discrete atomic spectra and the Zeeman Effect. The lab will also contain experiments on Brownian Mot ion and the determination of other properties of matter like magnetic susceptibility.  Pre-requisites: Physics Lab I.  The Physics of Matter (semester 6 ) In real physical systems the various areas of fundamental physics that are studied separately in pre vious semesters are usually required all at once. The purpose of this course is to show how fundamental physics can be used to study a number of interesting phenomena.  Pre-requisites: All mandatory courses in the physics -major sequence.     9 Elective Physics Courses  Elective courses (for the 3rd and 4th year) are listed below. Please refer to the course webpage for further details. These courses may be at the advanced UG or beginning graduate level. Note that all electives may not be offered every year.

Alternatively, students wishing to broaden their education further can use it to take a minor/concentration in any other subject or simply take whatev er courses in any department they wish to.  Advanced Major The advanced major is for students intending to pursue higher studies and research in physics. It would enable them to take some advanced physics courses as well as get an idea of research through the capstone project/thesis.  Requirements: 7th Semester: Required to take 16 credits of which the capstone project comprises 8 credits. The students can opt for 1 or 2 courses comprising 4 credits/course.  8th Semester: Required to take 16 credits of which the capstone project comprises 8 credits. The students can opt for 1 or 2 courses comprising 4 credits/course.  Over the whole year (2 semesters), some courses apart from Thesis may also be taken from outside the physics department .     11 Capstone Project and Thesis:  Interested students should talk, in their 6th semester, to prospective advisors about possible projects. After mutual agreement - the advisor agrees to guide the student and the student agrees to work on one of the projects suggested by the advisor - stude nts should start with necessary background reading / preliminary work over the summer before the start of the fourth year.  At the end of the 7th semester the project would be assessed with a presentation and report - this will be evaluated by the physics faculty. Students without satisfactory progress at this stage may not continue for the thesis subsequently.  At the end of the 8th semester the thesis has to be submitted and defended before a panel which may also include some external members. It is mandatory to successfully complete the capstone project and thesis to be eligible for the advanced major.  Other options (Minor/Concentration)  Students not opting for the advanced major can take courses as per their interest in the fourth year. It is reco mmended that physics majors take two physics electives over the year. Those minoring in physics (or taking it as a concentration) may take physics courses accordingly to meet the necessary requirements.               12 TF/TA -ship Policy ❖ The Teaching Fellows are recruited after a departmental screening process.  ❖ Fourth year (ASP) physics students can be TAs for some of the introductory physics courses. This depends on the departmental requirement and the position may be offered either for credits or may be a paid position.  ❖ MLS students are assigned to be TAs as a part of their academic requirements.  Independent Study Module (ISM) ❖ Students may opt for an ISM if interested and if a faculty member is available for this purpose.  ❖ A successfully completed ISM would contribute 2 to 4 credits to the student’s GPA.  ❖ Students who wish to take up an ISM should contact the Professor under whose guidance they wish to work to discuss details.       13 Faculty  Somendra M.

What are going to be the mandatory courses to pursue a minor in Physics? Answer: The gateway courses (Mathematical and Computational Toolkit and Laboratory 1) are the mandatory courses to pursue a physics minor. Apart from these two, the student is expected to take 4 courses of their choice. Of these 4 courses at least two should be taken from among the other core courses. The remaining two can be core or elective courses and one of them can also be an ISM. So, in total a student has to do 6 courses to complete a minor in Physics.  2. What are the mandatory courses for a concentration in Physics? Answer: The gateway courses (Mathematical and Computational Toolkit and Laboratory 1) are the mandatory courses to pursue a physics concentration. Apart from these two, the student is expected to take 2 courses of their choice from among the core courses. So, in total a student has to do 4 courses to complete a concentration in Physics.  3. What are the man datory courses for the Ashoka Scholar Programme (ASP) students? Answer: A project (Capstone project) and the Capstone thesis are mandatory for an Advanced Major in Physics.      21 4. Will the mandatory courses be offered every semester? Answer: The mandatory gateway courses are offered in the spring semesters. Other core courses are spread throughout the 6 semesters. All courses are not offered in every semester.  5. What are the prerequisites to major in Physics? Answer: The student is expected to have a sci ence/mathematics background in their high school (at +2 level). Calculus is a recommended course to be taken in their first semester.  6. I am interested in doing a TAship/writing a thesis although I’m not in my fourth year as yet. Answer: The current TAsh ip policy doesn't allow students (except 4th years) to become TAs.  7. Who should I contact in case I have further questions? Answer: You can reach out to the Academic Representative of the Department.  8. Is thesis mandatory for ASP students? Answer: Thesis is mandatory for an Advanced Major in Physics. See also Q 9.     22 9. Do the ASP 4th year count as an Advanced Major? Answer: Yes. But only if the capstone project + thesis option is chosen. Otherwise, the fourth year may be used to get a double major / minor in other subjects.  10. Will the labs be independent of the theory courses - in terms of number of credits? Answer: Yes. They are independent of the theory courses in terms of the number of credits - 4 credits for each theory course or lab.     ",6f21bc76-520e-47da-b7d2-1c3164562d51
529,"Sociology & Anthropology Handbook    GUIDELINES FOR STUDENTS Monsoon 2020  Department of Sociology & Anthropology Sociology & Anthropology at Ashoka The undergraduate programme in Sociology and Anthropology (SOA) at Ashoka University is       designed for students interested in cultivating an intellectually rigorous understanding of      diverse social worlds and processes as they emerge, stabilise, transform and dissolve all       around us.  The Department acknowledges the unique relationship between sociology and social      anthropology as it has developed and flourished in India. While our faculty is actively        engaged in long-term fieldwork and ethnographic research across a range of subjects and       sites, as a collective, we emphasise the critical empiricism, theoretical engagement and       comparative approach central to our best disciplinary traditions. In doing so, we constantly       work at and move between multiple scales and modes of analysis: across the ‘micro’ and        the ‘macro’, the ‘general’ and the ‘particular’, the ‘local’ and the ‘global’, the ‘social’ and the         ‘technical’, the ‘material’ and ‘abstract’, and the ‘qualitative’ and ‘quantitative’.  Our research and pedagogical practices also open up numerous possibilities for      interdisciplinary explorations with students and scholars in allied fields of social thought and       inquiry, including, history, economics, political science, psychology, philosophy, linguistics,     environmental studies, computer science, planning and design, natural sciences, arts and      aesthetics, law and media. This makes Sociology and Anthropology at once among the most        grounded and fluid disciplines in the contemporary university.  The Undergraduate Major in Sociology and Anthropology The Sociology and Anthropology Major at Ashoka will train future scholars and professionals       to be engaged observers, attentive readers, clear writers, and rigorous social analysts. Over       the course of their study, our students will develop a critical awareness of changing social        values and practices, the capacity to think relationally, and the skills to draw out vital but         often invisible connections. In this way, they will learn how to describe and explain complex        social processes. Above all, we are convinced that our students will engage with the world        and come to inhabit it in ways that open up new possibilities for shaping shared futures.         These possibilities are at the heart of what we think it means to nurture an anthropological         imagination. SOA Majors must complete 12 courses in the discipline to graduate with a B.A. in Sociology         and Anthropology. All students will take 6 (out of a set of 8) compulsory courses specially         designed to introduce them to the “core” fields of the discipline: key concepts and themes        that are at the centre of both classical and contemporary work in Sociology and        Anthropology. Building on and out from these courses, Majors will then select a series of 6        electives from a wide range of course offerings. All SOA courses, both cores and electives,        will create space for students to explore their own, individual interests and questions, but        the electives are especially intended to give advanced undergraduates a sense of the       breadth of the discipline and the frontiers of anthropological research. The set of core        courses also includes a hands-on Research Methods course that all Majors will take in their        third year. Instead of confining the Sociology and Anthropology of India to a single course,        the study of India and South Asia will be woven in throughout the curriculum and critical         themes (such as caste, hierarchy and stratification) will be explored in multiple and       interrelated courses. The Eight Core Courses:  SOA 1101: ​ Sociology and the Making of Concepts is our ‘Gateway Course’ and may be taken         in the first or second year at Ashoka. It is compulsory for all SOA Majors, who must         complete this course by the end of the second year.  In addition, Majors are required to take at least 4 of the following 6 courses. Most Majors         will complete this set of courses in their second year, but they can be taken in any order          depending on student interest and course sequencing in a given year. Students have the        option and are encouraged to take all 6 courses in this set should they wish to do so.  • SOA 2101: ​ State, Stateless Societies and the Problems of Power  • SOA 2102: ​ Gift, Commodity and the Exchange of Value  • SOA 2103: ​ Magic, Science, Religion  • SOA 2104: ​ Kin, Friends and Enemies • SOA 2105: ​ Language, Signs and the Problems of Representation • SOA 2106: ​ Nature’s Futures  SOA 3101: ​ Anthropology’s Methods is a research methods course specially designed for our       Majors. Although there is no thesis requirement for the 3 ​ rd year, all students will learn        research and proposal-writing skills in this course. Students planning to stay on for a fourth        year to complete an Advanced Major in Sociology and Anthropology will use this course to        develop proposals for their thesis fieldwork and research projects.  Electives  Electives will emerge from and deepen student engagement with the concepts and       approaches developed in the core courses while drawing on diverse faculty and student       interests. Electives will be designed as advanced undergraduate seminar courses.  Majors will take a total of 6 electives, of which at least 4 must be 3000-level courses. 2          courses can be chosen from the remaining 2000-level ‘cores’ or from the electives on offer.  The elective course offerings will change from year to year, but the list below provides a         sense of the range and depth of the electives that our faculty members have taught in the         past and are excited to develop and teach in future semesters at Ashoka.  • Language and Power in South Asia • Visuality, Power, and Truth • Being Human: Anthropology and the Anthropocene • The Right to Water • Political Ecology and Modes of Resistance • Agrarian Worlds • Cities, Villages, and What Lies Between  • The Anthropology of 'Remoteness': Highlands, Islands and Rainforests • Questioning Development • What is Globalisation?  • Work, Labour, Industry • Market Ethnographies • Fiscal Anthropology • Nationalism, Ethnicity, Violence • Freedom and Sovereignty • Hierarchy • Local Bureaucracies and the Everyday State • Trajectories of Capital • The Cultural Politics of Space, Place and Time • Borders and Crossings • Travel, Mobility and Identity • Gender, Sexuality and The Body • War and Media • Cybersociality • Data, Algorithms and the Anthropology of Numbers • The Anthropology of Dreams • Islam and Anthropology • The Secular and the Sacral • Medicine and Society • Anthropology of Mental Health  • Anthropology, Archive and History • Anthropology and Allied Arts • Anthropology and Philosophy • Statistics for Sociologists  Requirements  Majors in Sociology and Anthropology Requirements ​ : ​ Each student will take a total of 12 courses towards their major.

The Ashoka Scholars Program (4 ​ th ​ year) in Sociology and Anthropology  The fourth year will give Majors an opportunity to pursue an independent, original and        closely supervised research project, which will culminate in an undergraduate thesis. For       obtaining an Advanced Diploma in Sociology and Anthropology, students need to submit a       proposal in March. Detailed guidelines for the proposal will be shared with third years        during the Monsoon semester. The following are the guidelines for those considering the       Advanced Major in Sociology and Anthropology:  ● The course, ​ Anthropology’s Methods will help prospective Advanced Majors to      develop research proposals and plans. Fieldwork can be conducted over the summer       between semesters 6 & 7 continuing into semester 7.  ● In addition to working under the guidance of a faculty advisor, Advanced Majors will        participate in a ​ Monsoon and Spring Thesis Workshop ​ , each for 4 credits. These will        be intensive weekly sessions facilitated by different members of the faculty and will       focus on critical aspects of the research process: framing questions, fieldwork      methods, data analysis, working on annotated bibliographies, developing    anthropological arguments, and ethnographic writing. Students will make regular     presentations and share their writing with each other.  ● The final thesis should be between 10,000-15,000 words and cover 8 credits (4 each        semester). The thesis will be evaluated by the faculty advisor.  ● Fourth-years will also have the opportunity to gain experience as ​ Teaching      Assistants ​ (with a minimum of 2 credits of Teaching Practicum).  ● The ASP cohort will also organise (for 2 credits per student) an ​ annual Symposium        hosted by the department and conceptualised, curated and organised by the      fourth-year students.  ● To complete the required 24 credits, fourth-years will be able to take an ​ additional 1        departmental elective ​ to broaden and deepen their engagement with the discipline.  Please note that ASP students can take more than one course either in Sociology or other         subjects during their ASP programme, but that would not count towards 24 credits.  The Department also welcomes students who wish to stay on for a fourth year at Ashoka         and utilise the Ashoka Scholars Programme (ASP) to complete a Concentration, Minor or       Second Major Equivalent in Sociology and Anthropology as well as those fourth years keen        to expand their intellectual exploration through our course offerings beyond formal      requirements. Graduating as a Major student from the Department is required in order to        write a thesis with the Department.  Year Advisors  To help you navigate through your journey with the Sociology and Anthropology       Department at Ashoka University, we have decided to have year wise faculty advisors. They        will help you understand the curriculum, requirements, course selection, etc throughout the       year. The following are the faculty members that you can contact, depending on which year        you are in:  Rising First Years ​ : Prof. Durba Chattaraj Rising Second Years ​ : Prof. Mitul Baruah Rising Third Years ​ : Prof. Aditi Saraf  Frequently Asked Questions  Q: Is the 1000/2000/3000 level system an equivalent to the 100/200/300 level system? A: ​ Yes.  Q: Is it mandatory for majors to finish 1101 by the end of second year? A ​ : Yes. Majors must complete this course by the end of their second year. Q: Is it mandatory to complete the 2000 level core course requirement by the end of the second year? A ​ : It is not mandatory, but we strongly recommend that you do so since 3000 level electives require at least two of the 2000 level core courses as prerequisites and you will get much more from these courses if you have taken the set of 2000-level cores.  Q: What is the policy on cross-listed courses? A ​ : Cross-listed courses are those courses which arise out of a discipline different from SOA but are cross-listed with SOA. The students can only count two cross listed courses towards their Major and Minor.  Q: Do the prerequisites also apply to the 3000 level cross-listed courses or summer courses? A ​ : Yes.  Q: I took a course in Monsoon 2019 which was cross-listed with SOA. It is being offered again in 2020 but is not showing as cross-listed. Is this a problem? A ​ : No. It is normal for courses to not be cross-listed with other departments in every semester that they’re offered. If you took a course, which was cross-listed in the semester that you took it, it will count towards your degree. Please cross-check the course code of such courses in your LMS.  Q: Can I write a thesis in the third year? A ​ : No. Only ASPs can write a thesis with the department.  Q: I’m going on a semester abroad. Can I substitute the required courses with a summer abroad course? A ​ : The specific course along with its detailed syllabus will need to be shared with the Department’s HOD and a decision will be taken on a case-by-case basis.  Q: I’m interested in TAing for the Monsoon semester. How should I proceed? A ​ : Only ASP students are eligible to TA for courses. The Department notifies all ASPs of TA requirements in the beginning of the semester and calls for applications.  Q: Whom should I contact for further queries? A ​ : You can email the Student Representative ​ Reeva Dani ​ (reeva.dani_ug20@ashoka.edu.in) and cc the Department Manager ​ Anjali Panwar ​ (anjali.panwar@ashoka.edu.in) for any queries.  Q: I am confused about which 2000 level (or 3000 level) courses to opt for. Is there someone I can talk to? A ​ : You may consult the course descriptions provided on the LMS or may reach out to your peers or seniors who have already taken courses you may be interested in. You can also consult your year advisor for seeking guidance.  Q: I’m unsure whether I want to major in Sociology or in Politics and Society. Is there someone I can talk to? A ​ : You can consult your year advisor for seeking guidance related to the discipline and the department.  Q: Is there a definitive order that courses have to be taken in? A ​ : We recommend that you take the 1000 level course first. Then take the core 2000 level core courses. This will not only ensure that you have fulfilled the prerequisites for the 3000-level electives, but you will get much more from the advanced elective courses when you take them.  Q: Can I take 2000 level courses before the 1000 level introductory requirement? A ​ : Yes, you can take the 2000 level core courses before the 1000 level courses, but we recommend that you take 1101 as your first course in SOA and then opt for 2000 level core courses.  Q: Can I opt for 3000 level courses while taking 2000 level courses at the same time? A ​ : Yes, you can, provided you fulfill the prerequisite for 3000 level electives, which is 1101 and any two 2000 level courses.  Q: Can the elective requirements be fulfilled by any 2000 or 3000 level courses? A ​ : After fulfilling the required number of level-based requirements, you are free to take 2000 or 3000 level courses to fulfill your remaining requirements  ",cc00d77d-6591-4e16-9bf0-fdae4f07e8a2

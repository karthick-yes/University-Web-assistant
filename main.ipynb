Academic Opportunities 3.1 Complimentary Disciplines Computer Science is a very versatile subject - with applications transcending multiple disciplines. At Ashoka, we have 2 interdisciplinary courses in CS, along with Entrepreneurship and Mathematics. Apart from these, it is also common for students studying CS at Ashoka to enroll in courses from Mathematics, Economics, Physics and Biology. 3.2 Study Abroad Programs Note that, like any other program at Ashoka, the Study Abroad Programs are subject to changes. Kindly refer to the GESP website for the latest information. Additionally, contact the departmental HOD for further clariﬁcation regarding credit transfers Every summer, international summer schools offer undergraduate courses in different subjects and ﬁelds. These courses can be transferred (subject to faculty approval) to the total credits taken as Ashoka. The Ofﬁce of Global Education and Strategic Programmes (GESP) is available to students for assistance and counselling in the application process. Ashoka is currently partnered with Wellesley College, UC Berkeley, University of Pennsyl- vania, Yale University, King’s College London, University of Michigan, Penn Engineering, Sciences Po, and Trinity College Dublin . Students can also apply for research and internship opportunities abroad to get practical experience in their ﬁelds of interest through a competitive process. These opportunities are available in Lehigh University, NTU Singapore, Koç University etc.']]}\n",
